*NL*
It
was
the

outburst
three

turned
some

Australian
MMEND
public
against

Under
pressure
from
international

Jewish

MMSTART_26748
Swiss
MMEND

devised
a

MMSTART_22936
Polish

brewer
Zywiec
's
1996
profit
slump
may
last
into
next
year
due
in
part
to
hefty
depreciation
charges
,
but
recent
high
investment
should
help
the
firm
defend
its
10-percent
market
share
,
the
firm
's
chief
executive
said
.
*NL*
Company
President
Jean
van
Boxmeer
told
MMSTART_18998750
Reuters
MMEND
in
an
interview
on
Friday
that
the
firm
,
whose
net
profit
fell
77
percent
in
the
first
10
months
of
1996
despite
a
30-percent
rise
in
sales
,
might
only
post
slightly
better
profits
in
1997
before
having
a
chance
to
make
a
more
significant
turnaround
.
*NL*
So
far
this
year
Zywiec
,
whose
full
name
is
Zaklady
Piwowarskie
w
Zywcu
SA
,
has
netted
six
million
zlotys
on
sales
of
224
million
zlotys
.
*NL*
It
has
produced
1.5
million
hectolitres
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
would
not
say
how
much
higher
1997
profits
or
market
share
could
be
but
said
sales
of
leading
MMSTART_22936
Polish
MMEND
brewers
should
rise
as
the
country
's
young
urban
professionals
gradually
switch
from
vodka
to
beer
.
*NL*
"
The
perspective
on
growth
is
such
that
reasonably
we
can
think
that
somewhere
between
65
and
80
litres
per
year
is
certainly
reachable
,
"
van
Boxmeer
said
on
MMSTART_22936
Polish
MMEND
per-capita
beer
consumption
,
currently
around
40
litres
.
*NL*
He
said
the
65-80-litre
level
could
be
reached
in
the
next
ten
years
and
make
MMSTART_22936
Poland
MMEND
,
with
its
40-million
population
,
MMSTART_9239
Europe
MMEND
's
third
largest
beer
market
after
MMSTART_11867
Germany
MMEND
and
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
said
MMSTART_22936
Poland
MMEND
's
top
five
brewers
,
which
produce
about
55
percent
of
the
country
's
beer
,
could
all
raise
market
share
as
some
of
the
numerous
small
brewers
fall
to
competition
from
the
large
brewers
with
foreign
investors
.
*NL*
Zywiec
is
31.8-percent
owned
by
MMSTART_150133
Heineken
MMEND
while
MMSTART_325070
Carlsberg
MMEND
has
the
same
amount
in
MMSTART_9889109
Okocim
MMEND
.
*NL*
Earlier
this
year
South
African
Breweries
Ltd
(
MMSTART_419331
SAB
MMEND
)
bought
strategic
stakes
in
the
unlisted
Lech
and
MMSTART_74608
Tychy
MMEND
brewers
,
which
together
hold
more
than
20
percent
of
the
market
,
and
MMSTART_4689264
Australia
MMEND
's
Brewpole

has
a
controlling
stake
in
MMSTART_22936
Poland
MMEND
's
larges
t
brewery
,
Elbrewery
Company
Ltd.
(
EB
)
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
said
the
tough
competition
had
prevented
Zywiec
from
raising
prices
in
line
with
inflation
,
which
had
added
to
the
pressure
on
the
firm
's
margins
.
*NL*
He
said
advertising
costs
would
also
increase
in
the
fight
for
market
share
.
*NL*
But
he
said
the
company
's
investment
of
more
than
$
100
million
already
this
decade
,
largely
in
production
,
would
help
position
it
to
compete
with
such
competitors
as
brewers
from
the
neighbouring
MMSTART_5321
Czech
Republic
MMEND
.
*NL*
Some
analysts
say
cheaper
but
high-quality
MMSTART_5321
Czech
MMEND
imports
could
invade
MMSTART_22936
Poland
MMEND
once
tariffs
for
MMSTART_459244
CEFTA
MMEND
countries
are
lifted
in
1998
,
but
van
Boxmeer
says
such
a
threat
might
be
exaggerated
despite
the
MMSTART_5321
Czech
MMEND
beer
market
's
overcapacity
.
*NL*
"
I
think
MMSTART_22936
Polish
MMEND
consumers
in
general
are
quite
proud
of
their
beers
--
and
I
'm
speaking
about
all
the
brands
--
and
as
we
make
good
beers
...
*NL*
I
think
that
this
fidelity
to
our
beers
is
a
factor
which
can
limit
the
MMSTART_5321
Czech
MMEND
beers
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
said
Zywiec
had
its
eye
on
Okocim
,
which
has
said
it
would
start
producing
MMSTART_325070
Carlsberg
MMEND
beer
next
year
,
but
that
Zywiec
's
potential
production
of
MMSTART_4793292
Heineken
MMEND
was
a
medium-term
possibility
rather
than
a
short-term
one
.
*NL*
He
said
his
firm
would
be
better
off
concentrating
on
its
leading
brand
,
Zywiec
Full
Light
,
which
accounts
for
85
percent
of
sales
and
is
the
country
's
largest-selling
brand
.
*NL*
"
You
will
not
win
the
war
of
the
MMSTART_22936
Polish
MMEND
beer
market
with
imported
international
brands
,
"
van
Boxmeer
said
,
adding
that
MMSTART_4793292
Heineken
MMEND
would
remain
an
up-market
import
in
MMSTART_22936
Poland
MMEND
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
also
said
Zywiec
would
be
boosted
by
its
recent
shedding
of
soft
drinks
which
only
accounted
for
about
three
percent
of
the
firm
's
overall
sales
and
for
which
7.6
million
zlotys
in
provisions
had
already
been
made

Ian

MMEND
added
that
even
if

final

MMEND
to
liberalise

which

*NL*

he
supported
conditions
proposed

MMEND

Office
of

MMEND
,
which

*NL*
"

there

*NL*
The
conditions
for

were
that

MMEND

However

"
than
those
imposed
by

.
*NL*
MMSTART_3970
British

MMEND
's
initial
response
was
that
"
unconditional
divestiture
of

is
unprecedented
and
if

it
must
be

MMSTART_1100754

may
not
be

*NL*
They
said
the
Santa

deal
,
which
includes
desirable

would
only
payoff

,

limits

his

If

the

over

most
of

gone
home

*NL*
The

do
not

*NL*
MMSTART_45773

's
most

liposuction
in

with
about
30,000
operations
a

at
a
cost

$
3,000

$
4,000
each
.
*NL*
Stomach
tucks
and
breast
operations
are
also
popular
since
the
tropical
climate
calls
for
flesh-baring
fashions

unlike

elsewhere
MMSTART_3383
Brazilians

tend
to
have
breast
reductions

"

They

On

Tuesday

from

launched
protests
against
what
they
said
was
unfair
handling
by

of
a
brawl
between
some
of

restaurant

in

*NL*
On

was
restricted

*NL*
She
was

being
detained
briefly
by

in

MMSTART_57404

*NL*
The

were
the

seen
in

since
the
student-led
pro-democracry
demonstrations
of
September
1988
when

crushed

Earlier

some
of

who
were

briefly
by

earlier
this

said
they
were
still
dissatisfied
with

.
*NL*
They
told

they
were
unhappy
that
the

had
not
heeded
their
calls
for
the

*NL*
"

The

*NL*

a

production

a

*NL*
For

,
Matthew
added
.
*NL*
"
Though
schemes
designed
to
realise
further
increases
in
the
production
of

are
being
operated
successfully
,
the

gap
is
expected
to
widen
,
"
he
said

*NL*
MMSTART_14533
Indian
MMEND
synthetic
rubber
output
is
not
expected
to
rise
significantly
in
the
next
season
but
demand
will
rise
to
145,000
tonnes
.
*NL*
Matthew
estimates
that
by
the
2000/01
season
,
the
gap
between
natural
rubber
output
and
consumption
will
rise
to
51,000

and
319,000
tonnes
in
2010/11
.
*NL*
Natural
rubber
production
will
go
up
to
695,000
tonnes
in
2000/01
against
consumption
of
746,000
tonnes
.
*NL*
In
2010/11
,
domestic
demand
should
rise
further
to
1.233
million
tonnes
while
production
will
only
reach
about
914,000
tonnes
.
*NL*
One
way
to
bridge
the
widening
gap
is
to
put
more
land
under
cultivation
which
the
MMSTART_19385859
Rubber
Board
MMEND
official
estimates
will
reach
220,000
hectares
between
now
and
the

2003
although
Matthew
said
this
may
not
be
possible
at
this
time
in
MMSTART_14533
India
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
The
development
objective
for
the
rubber
plantation
industry
will
be
to
increase
production
to
the
best
extent
possibly
with
a
view
to
minimising
imports
of

*NL*

the

it

Market
participants
have
kept
a
close
eye
on
Sakakibara
,
chief
of

as
a
comment
he
made
in
November
after
the
dollar
hit
this
year
's
high
of
114.92
yen
pushed
the
currency
down
sharply
.
*NL*
He
had
said
then
that
the
market
's
view
on
MMSTART_15573
Japan
MMEND
's
economy
was
too
pessimistic
and
that
he
believed
it
was
stronger
than

thought
.
*NL*
Dealers
have
come
to
refer
to
115

as
the

ceiling
"
for

following

remark
.
*NL*
Adding
to
the
comments
by
"
Mr

"
,
as
Sakakibara
is
known
for

prominence
in

*NL*
"
The
recent

has
been
stable
,
and
it
does
not
appear
to
be
moving

a

Matsushita
said
in

interview
with
the

Shimbun
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
The
fact

Lahd
,
a
69-year-old

major-general
,
heads

*NL*
Lahd
said
a
few
days
after
the
trial
began
on
February
16
that
MMSTART_17771
Lebanese
MMEND
authorities
must
drop
the
charges
or
risk
blocking

deal
with
the
MMSTART_25955086

He
said
MMSTART_9282173
Israel
MMEND
was
capable
of
pressuring
MMSTART_17771
Lebanon
MMEND
's
Syrian-backed
government
to
stop
the

.
*NL*
The
charges
against
Lahd
were
:
forming
a
hostile
army
,
carrying
weapons
on
MMSTART_9282173
Israel
MMEND
's
side
,
helping
MMSTART_9282173
Israel
MMEND
strip
off
a
part
of
MMSTART_17771
Lebanese
MMEND
territory
by
violence
,
forming

killing

civilians
by

shelling
and
kidnapping

*NL*
Shortly
before

,
a
MMSTART_37428
Beirut
MMEND
military

charged
another

army
soldiers
with
collaborating
with
MMSTART_9282173
Israel
MMEND
.
*NL*
No

the
MMSTART_1224174

MMEND
living

in

MMSTART_17771
Lebanon
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_9282173
Israel
MMEND

Lahd
have
repeatedly
demanded
safety

the
MMSTART_1224174
SLA
MMEND
--
a
mixed
Christian-Shi'ite
MMSTART_6037917
Moslem
MMEND
force
--
which
the

Jewish
MMEND
states
regards

.
*NL*
MMSTART_9282173
Israel
MMEND
has
said
the
MMSTART_17771
Lebanese
MMEND
army
must
incorporate
the
MMSTART_1224174
SLA
MMEND
fighters
into
its
ranks
as
an

brigade
as
a
condition
for

.
*NL*
But
MMSTART_17771
Lebanese
MMEND
political
analysts
have
said
that
would
be
out
of
the
question
and
MMSTART_17771
Lebanese
MMEND
authorities
pre-empted
the
issue
by
taking
legal
action
against

.
*NL*
Former

MMSTART_48569
Shimon

MMEND
,
calling
Lahd
"

"
,
said
earlier
this

MMSTART_17771
Lebanon

*NL*
"

a

Derek

,
senior

MMEND
(

,
said
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
's

underscoring
its

"
*NL*
There
is
the
international
prestige
MMSTART_27318

would
enjoy
,
but
"
more
importantly
there
is
a
genuine
national
interest
in

said

of

*NL*
At

trade

will
review
the
work
of
the
MMSTART_33873

the

Uruguay
MMEND
Round
free

*NL*
In
June
,
the
MMSTART_33873

MMEND
hailed
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
for
its
open

policies
but
the
MMSTART_9317
European
Union
MMEND
and
other

called
on
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
to
speed
up
the
opening

.
*NL*
Supple
said
the
struggle
that
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
had
to
wage
in
vying
to
host
the
meeting
would
be
repeated
during
the
talks
.
*NL*
"
There
is
tension
at
every
step
of
the
way
,
"
since
a
battle
line
between
the
West
and
developing
countries
has
been
drawn
over
the
issue
of
linking
trade
liberalisation
with
labour
rights
,
he
said
.
*NL*
Supple
said
hosting
the
meeting
carried
prestige
for
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
,
"
however
,
this
is
quite
intangible
as
the
prestige
factor
may
not
necessarily
lead
to
any
additional
investment
and
trade
flows
to
this
region
.
"
*NL*
From
a
commercial
point
of
view
,
the
meeting
would
be
good
for
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
's
tourism
industry
,
Tan
said
.
*NL*
A
large
part
of
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
's
workforce
would
be
mobilised
to
ensure
the
meeting
would
run
without
a
glitch
but
the
average
Singaporean
"
would
probably
not
be
too
concerned
about
some
of
the
issues
,
"
Tan
said
.
*NL*
"
But
the
more
educated
public
will
realise
that
these
kind
of
things
are
important
for
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
as
a
small
economy
.
"
*NL*
Supple
said
any
political
gains
the
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
government
would
get
from
the
MMSTART_33873
WTO
MMEND
meeting
--
ahead
of
a
general
election
due
by
April
1997
--
would
depend
on
how
successful
it
was
in
pushing
its
economic
agenda
.
*NL*
"
If
there
are
any
movements
toward
freer
trade
,
then
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
's
economy
and
the
electorate
would
gain
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
wise
to
play
up
the
political
aspect
of
this
.
*NL*
I
think
political
issues
will
take
secondary
importance
to
all
these
economic
issues

*NL*
One

.
*NL*
For
the
third

,
Friday

were
cancelled
due
to
heavy
wet
snow

fog
on

call
for

one
training

to
be
completed
before

can
be

.
*NL*
Organisers
hope
to
get
that
run
in
on
Saturday
morning
,
conditions
permitting
,
and
stage
the
race
later
in
the
day
or
on
Sunday
.
*NL*
"
There
was
no
possibility
today
to
make
a
training
run
,
"
said
Bernd
Zobel
,
the
Canadian
men
's
national
coach
,
citing
too
much
new
snow
and
poor
visibility
.
*NL*
If
organisers
are
forced
to
run
the
downhill
on
Sunday
,
the
super-giant
slalom
originally
scheduled
for
Sunday
would
likely
be
abandoned

will
