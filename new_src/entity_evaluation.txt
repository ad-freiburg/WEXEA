Richard Francis Burton

[[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Francis Burton|annotation]] (; [[19 March 1821|DATE]] – [[20 October 1890|DATE]]) was a British explorer, geographer, translator, writer, soldier, orientalist, cartographer, ethnographer, ethnologist, spy, linguist, poet, fencer, [[Freemasonry|Freemason|annotation]], and diplomat.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] was famed for [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] travels and explorations in [[Asia|Asia|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Africa|Africa|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and the [[Americas|Americas|LOCATION_popular_entity]], as well as [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures.

According to [[one|NUMBER]] count, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] spoke [[29|NUMBER]] [[Languages of Europe|European|annotation]], [[Languages of Asia|Asian|annotation]], and [[Languages of Africa|African languages|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s best-known achievements include: a well-documented journey to [[Mecca|Mecca|annotation]] in disguise, at a time when Europeans were forbidden access on pain of death; an unexpurgated translation of "[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night|One Thousand and One Nights|annotation]]" (commonly called "The Arabian [[Nights|TIME]]" in English after early translations of [[Antoine Galland|Antoine Galland|annotation]]'s French version); the publication of the "[[Kama Sutra|Kama Sutra|annotation]]" in English; a translation of "[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden|annotation]]", the "Arab "[[Kama Sutra|Kama Sutra|alias_match_match_candidate]]""; and a journey with [[John Hanning Speke|John Hanning Speke|annotation]] as the [[first|ORDINAL]] Europeans to visit the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes of Africa|annotation]] in search of the source of the [[Nile|Nile|annotation]].

[[William Henry Wilkins|William Henry Wilkins|annotation]] wrote: "So far as I can gather from all I have learned, the chief value of [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]’s version of "The Scented Garden" lay not so much in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] translation of the text, though that of course was admirably done, as in the copious notes and explanations which [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had gathered together for the purpose of annotating the book.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] had made this subject a study of [[years|DURATION]].

For the notes of the book alone [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had been collecting material for [[thirty years|DURATION]], though [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] actual translation of it only took [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] [[eighteen months|DURATION]]."

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was a captain in the army of the [[East India Company|East India Company|annotation]], serving in [[India|India|alias_match_popular_entity]], and later briefly in the [[Crimean War|Crimean War|annotation]].

In later life, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] served as [[East India Company|British|alias_match_single_candidate]] consul in [[Bioko|Fernando Pó|annotation]] ([[now|DATE]] [[Bioko|Bioko|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Equatorial Guinea|Equatorial Guinea|LOCATION_popular_entity]]), [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos|annotation]] in [[Brazil|Brazil|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Damascus|Damascus|annotation]] ([[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman Syria|annotation]]), and finally in [[Trieste|Trieste|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] was a [[Royal Geographical Society|Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and was awarded a knighthood in [[1886|DATE]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[Torquay|Torquay|annotation]], [[Devon|Devon|LOCATION_popular_entity]], at [[21:30 on 19|TIME]] [[March 1821|DATE]]; in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] autobiography, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] incorrectly claimed to have been born in the family home at [[Barham House|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Elstree|Elstree|annotation]] in [[Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire|LOCATION_match_candidate]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] was baptized on [[2 September 1821|DATE]] at [[Elstree|Elstree|alias_match_match_candidate]] Church in [[Borehamwood|Borehamwood|annotation]], [[Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire|LOCATION_match_candidate]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] father, [[Lieutenant colonel|Lt.-Colonel|annotation]] Joseph Netterville [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], of the [[36th Regiment|ORGANIZATION]], was an Irish-born [[British Army|British army|annotation]] officer of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish|annotation]] extraction who through [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] mother's family—the Campbells of [[Tuam|Tuam|annotation]]—was a [[first|ORDINAL]] cousin of [[Henry Pearce Driscoll|Lt.-Colonel Henry Peard Driscoll|annotation]] and [[Richard Graves (theologian)|Mrs Richard Graves|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Richard|alias_match_article_entity]]'s mother, [[Martha Baker|PERSON]], was the daughter and co-heiress of a wealthy [[Anglo-Irish people|English|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] squire, [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard|alias_match_article_entity]] Baker ([[1762|DATE]]–[[1824|DATE]]), of [[Barham House|ORGANIZATION]], [[Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire|annotation]], for whom [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was named.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] had [[two|NUMBER]] siblings, Maria Katherine Elizabeth [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] (who married Lt.-General Sir [[Henry William Stisted|Henry William Stisted|annotation]]) and Edward Joseph Netterville [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], born in [[1823|DATE]] and [[1824|DATE]], respectively.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s family travelled extensively during [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] childhood and employed various tutors to educate [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]].

In [[1829|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] began a formal education at a preparatory school in [[Richmond Green|Richmond Green|annotation]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond, Surrey|annotation]], run by Reverend [[Charles Delafosse|PERSON]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] showed a talent to learn languages and quickly learned French, Italian, [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan|annotation]] and [[Latin|Latin|annotation]], as well as several dialects.

During [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] youth, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] allegedly had an affair with a [[Romani people|Roma|annotation]] girl and learned the rudiments of the [[Romani language|Romani language|annotation]].

The peregrinations of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] youth may have encouraged [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] to regard himself as an outsider for much of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] life.

As [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] put it, "Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause".

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] matriculated at [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College, Oxford|annotation]], on [[19 November 1840|DATE]].

Before getting a room at the college, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] lived for a short time in the house of [[William Alexander Greenhill|William Alexander Greenhill|annotation]], then doctor at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary|Radcliffe Infirmary|annotation]].

Despite [[William Alexander Greenhill|his|PERSON_coref]] intelligence and ability, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was antagonised by [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] teachers and peers.

During [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] term, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] is said to have challenged another student to a duel after the latter mocked [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s moustache.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] continued to gratify [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] love of languages by studying Arabic; [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] also spent [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] time learning falconry and fencing.

In [[April 1842|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] attended a steeplechase in deliberate violation of college rules and subsequently dared to tell the college authorities that students should be allowed to attend such events.

Hoping to be merely "rusticated"—that is, suspended with the possibility of reinstatement, the punishment received by some less provocative students who had also visited the steeplechase—[[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was instead permanently expelled from [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College|alias_match_single_candidate]].

According to [[Ed Rice|PERSON]], speaking on [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s university [[days|DURATION]], "[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] stirred the bile of the dons by speaking real—that is, [[Latin|Roman|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]—[[Latin|Latin|alias_match_match_candidate]] instead of the artificial type peculiar to [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] spoke Greek Romaically, with the accent of [[Athens|Athens|LOCATION_popular_entity]], as [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had learned it from a Greek merchant at [[Marseille|Marseilles|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], as well as the classical forms.

Such a linguistic feat was a tribute to [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s remarkable ear and memory, for [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was only a teenager when [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was in [[Italy|Italy|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and southern [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] own words, "fit for nothing but to be shot at for [[six pence|MONEY]] [[a day|DURATION]]", [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] enlisted in the army of the [[East India Company|East India Company|annotation]] at the behest of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] ex-college classmates who were already members.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] hoped to fight in the first Afghan war, but the conflict was over before [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] arrived in [[India|India|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] was posted to the [[18th Bombay Native Infantry|ORGANIZATION]] based in [[Gujarat|Gujarat|annotation]] and under the command of General [[Charles James Napier|Charles James Napier|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s interest (and active participation) in the cultures and religions of [[India|India|alias_match_popular_entity]] was considered peculiar by some of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] fellow soldiers, who accused [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] of "going native" and called [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] "the White Nigger".

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] did have many peculiar habits that set [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] apart from other soldiers.

While in the army, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] kept a large menagerie of tame monkeys in the hopes of learning their language, accumulating [[sixty|NUMBER]] "words".

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] also earned the name "Ruffian Dick" for [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] "demonic ferocity as a fighter and because [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had fought in single combat more enemies than perhaps any other man of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] time".

According to [[Ed Rice|PERSON]], "[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] [[now|DATE]] regarded [[the seven years|DURATION]] in [[India|India|alias_match_popular_entity]] as time wasted."

Yet, "[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] had already passed the official examinations in [[six|NUMBER]] languages and was studying [[two|NUMBER]] more and was eminently qualified."

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] religious experiences were varied, including attending Catholic services, becoming a [[Nāgar Brāhmin|PERSON]], adopting [[Sikhism|Sikhism|annotation]], conversion to Islam, and undergoing "chillá" for [[Qadiriyya|Qadiri|annotation]] [[Sufism|Sufism|annotation]].

Regarding [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s Muslim beliefs, Ed Rice states, "Thus, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was circumcised, and made a Muslim, and lived like a Muslim and prayed and practiced like [[one|NUMBER]]."

Furthermore, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], "...was entitled to call himself a "hāfiz", [[one|NUMBER]] who can recite the Qur'ān from memory."

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s pilgrimage to [[Medina|Medina|annotation]] and [[Mecca|Mecca|annotation]] in [[1853|DATE]], was [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] realization of "the plans and hopes of many and many [[a year|DURATION]]...to study thoroughly the inner life of the Moslem."

Traveling through [[Alexandria|Alexandria|annotation]] in [[April|DATE]], then [[Cairo|Cairo|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[May|DATE]], where [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] stayed in [[June|DATE]] during [[Ramadan|Ramadan|annotation]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] [[first|ORDINAL]] donned the guise of a [[Persian language|Persian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] "mirza", then a Sunnī "Shaykh, doctor, magician and dervish.

Accompanied by an [[Culture of India|Indian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] boy slave called Nūr, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] further equipped himself with a case for carrying the Qur'ān, but instead had [[three|NUMBER]] compartments for [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] watch and compass, money, and penknife, pencils, and numbered pieces of paper for taking notes.

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] diary [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] kept in a break pocket, unseen.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] traveled onwards with a group of nomads to [[Suez|Suez|annotation]], sailed to [[Yanbu|Yambu|annotation]], and joined a caravan to [[Medina|Medina|alias_match_match_candidate]], where [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] arrived on [[27 July|DATE]], earning the title "Zair".

Departing [[Medina|Medina|alias_match_match_candidate]] with the [[Damascus|Damascus|alias_match_match_candidate]] caravan on [[31 August|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] entered [[Mecca|Mecca|alias_match_match_candidate]] on [[11 September|DATE]].

There, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] participated in the "Tawaf", traveled to [[Mount Arafat|Mount Arafat|annotation]], and participated in the [[Stoning of the Devil|Stoning of the Devil|annotation]], all the while taking notes on the [[Kaaba|Kaaba|annotation]], its [[Black Stone|Black Stone|annotation]], and the [[Zamzam Well|Zamzam Well|annotation]].

Departing [[Mecca|Mecca|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] journeyed to [[Jeddah|Jeddah|annotation]], back to [[Cairo|Cairo|LOCATION_popular_entity]], returning to duty in [[Mumbai|Bombay|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

In [[India|India|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] wrote [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] "Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-[[Medina|Medinah|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and Meccah".

Of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] journey, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] wrote, "at [[Mecca|Mecca|alias_match_match_candidate]] there is nothing theatrical, nothing that suggests the opera, but all is simple and impressive...tending, I believe, after its fashion, to good."

Motivated by [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] love of adventure, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] got the approval of the [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society|annotation]] for an exploration of the area, and [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] gained permission from the board of directors of the [[East India Company|East India Company|alias_match_match_candidate]] to take leave from the army.

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] [[seven years|DURATION]] in [[India|India|alias_match_popular_entity]] gave [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] a familiarity with the customs and behaviour of [[Muslims|Muslims|annotation]] and prepared [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] to attempt a [[Hajj|Hajj|annotation]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca|Mecca|annotation]] and, in this case, [[Medina|Medina|annotation]]).

It was this journey, undertaken in [[1853|DATE]], which [[first|ORDINAL]] made [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] famous.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] had planned it whilst travelling disguised among the [[Muslims|Muslims|alias_match_match_candidate]] of [[Sindh|Sindh|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and had laboriously prepared for the adventure by study and practice (including undergoing the [[Muslims|Muslim|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] tradition of circumcision to further lower the risk of being discovered).

Although [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was certainly not the [[first|ORDINAL]] non-[[Muslims|Muslim|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] [[Languages of Europe|European|alias_match_single_candidate]] to make the "[[Hajj|Hajj|alias_match_match_candidate]]" ([[Ludovico di Varthema|Ludovico di Varthema|annotation]] did this in [[1503|DATE]] and [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|annotation]] in [[1815|DATE]]), [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|his|PERSON_coref]] pilgrimage is the most famous and the best documented of the time.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s trek to [[Mecca|Mecca|alias_match_match_candidate]] was dangerous, and [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] caravan was attacked by bandits (a common experience at the [[time|DATE]]).

As [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] put it, though "... neither [[Quran|Koran|annotation]] or [[Sultan|Sultan|annotation]] enjoin the death of Jew or Christian intruding within the columns that note the sanctuary limits, nothing could save a [[Languages of Europe|European|alias_match_single_candidate]] detected by the populace, or [[one|NUMBER]] who after pilgrimage declared himself an unbeliever".

The pilgrimage entitled [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] to the title of [[Hajji|Hajji|annotation]] and to wear the green head wrap.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s own account of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] journey is given in "A Personal Narrative of a [[Hajj|Pilgrimage|alias_match_single_candidate]] to [[Medina|Al-Madinah|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and Meccah".

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] sat for the examination as an [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]] linguist.

The examiner was [[Lambert Playfair|Robert Lambert Playfair|annotation]], who disliked [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]].

Having been told that [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] could be vindictive, and wishing to avoid any animosity should [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] fail, [[George Percy Badger|Badger|alias_match_single_candidate]] declined.

[[Lambert Playfair|Playfair|alias_match_single_candidate]] conducted the tests; despite [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s success living as an [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]], [[Lambert Playfair|Playfair|alias_match_single_candidate]] had recommended to the committee that [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] be failed.

[[George Percy Badger|Badger|alias_match_single_candidate]] later told [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] that "After looking [[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s test] over, I [had] sent them back to [[[Lambert Playfair|Playfair|alias_match_single_candidate]]] with a note eulogising your attainments and ... remarking on the absurdity of the [[Bombay Committee|ORGANIZATION]] being made to judge your proficiency inasmuch as I did not believe that any of them possessed a tithe of the knowledge of [[Arabic|Arabic|alias_match_match_candidate]] you did."

In [[May 1854|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] traveled to [[Aden|Aden|annotation]] in preparation for [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Somaliland|Somaliland|annotation]] Expedition, supported by the [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] undertook the expedition to [[Harar|Harar|annotation]], [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] investigated the [[Wady Nogal|PERSON]], while [[Herne|PERSON]] and Stroyan stayed on at [[Berbera|Berbera|annotation]].

According to [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], "A tradition exists that with the entrance of the [[first|ORDINAL]] [white] Christian [[Harar|Harar|alias_match_match_candidate]] will fall."

With [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s entry, the "Guardian Spell" was broken.

This [[Somaliland|Somaliland|alias_match_match_candidate]] Expedition lasted from 29October [[1854|DATE]] to 9February [[1855|DATE]], with much of the time spent in the port of [[Zeila|Zeila|annotation]], where [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was a guest of [[Tuam|the town|non_person_coref]]'s Governor al-[[Hajji|Haji|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] Sharmakay bin [[Ali Salih|PERSON]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], "assuming the disguise of an [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]] merchant" called [[Hajji|Haji|annotation]] Mirza Abdullah, awaited word that the road to [[Harar|Harar|alias_match_match_candidate]] was safe.

On [[29 December|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] met with [[Gerard Adan|PERSON]] in the village of [[Sagharrah|LOCATION]], when [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] openly proclaimed himself an [[East India Company|English|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] officer with a letter for the [[Emir|Amīr|annotation]] of [[Harar|Harar|alias_match_match_candidate]].

On [[3 January 1855|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] made it to [[Harar|Harar|alias_match_match_candidate]], and was graciously met by the [[Emir|Amir|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] stayed in [[Harar|the city|non_person_coref]] for [[ten days|DURATION]], officially a guest of the [[Emir|Amir|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] but in reality [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] prisoner.

The journey back was plagued by lack of supplies, and [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] wrote that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] would have died of thirst had [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] not seen desert birds and realized they would be near water.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] made it back to [[Berbera|Berbera|alias_match_match_candidate]] on [[31 January 1855|DATE]].

Following this adventure, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] prepared to set out in search of the source of the [[Nile|Nile|alias_match_match_candidate]], accompanied by Lieutenant [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]], Lieutenant [[G. E. Herne|PERSON]] and Lieutenant [[William Stroyan|PERSON]] and a number of Africans employed as bearers.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was impaled with a javelin, the point entering [[one|NUMBER]] cheek and exiting the other.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] was forced to make [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] escape with the weapon still transfixing [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] head.

It was no surprise then that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] found the [[Somalis|Somalis|alias_match_match_candidate]] to be a "fierce and turbulent race".

However, the failure of this expedition was viewed harshly by the authorities, and a [[two-year|DURATION]] investigation was set up to determine to what extent [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was culpable for this disaster.

While [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was largely cleared of any blame, this did not help [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] career.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] describes the harrowing attack in "[[First Anglo-Afghan War|First|alias_match_single_candidate]] Footsteps in East [[Africa|Africa|alias_match_popular_entity]]" ([[1856|DATE]]).

After recovering from [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] wounds in [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] traveled to [[Constantinople|Constantinople|LOCATION_popular_entity]] during the [[Crimean War|Crimean War|annotation]], seeking a commission.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] received [[one|NUMBER]] from General [[W.F. Beatson|PERSON]], as the [[Chief of staff|Chief of staff|annotation]] for "Beatson's Horse", popularly called the Bashi-bazouks, and based in [[Gallipoli|Gallipoli|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] returned after an incident which disgraced [[Beatson|PERSON]], and implicated [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] as the instigator of a "mutiny", damaging [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] reputation.

In [[1856|DATE]], the [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society|alias_match_match_candidate]] funded another expedition for [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]], "and exploration of the then utterly unknown [[African Great Lakes|Lake regions of Central Africa|annotation]]."

From the beginning, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] were hindered by disease, malaria, fevers, and other maladies, at times both having to be carried in a hammock.

Yet, on [[7 November 1857|DATE]], they made it to [[Tabora|Kazeh|annotation]], and departed for [[Ujij|ORGANIZATION]] on [[14 Dec|DATE]] [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] wanted to head north, sure they would find the source of the [[Nile|Nile|alias_match_match_candidate]] at what [[John Hanning Speke|he|PERSON_coref]] later named [[Lake Victoria|Victoria Nyanza|annotation]], but [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] persisted in heading west.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was awestruck by the sight of the magnificent lake, but [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]], who had been temporarily blinded, was unable to see the body of water.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was again taken ill on the return journey; [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] continued exploring without [[John Hanning Speke|him|PERSON_coref]], making a journey to the north and eventually locating the great [[Lake Victoria|Lake Victoria|annotation]], or [[Lake Victoria|Victoria Nyanza|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], on [[3 August|DATE]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s description of the journey is given in "Lake Regions of Equatorial [[Africa|Africa|alias_match_popular_entity]]" ([[1860|DATE]]).

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] made it back to [[Zanzibar|Zanzibar|alias_match_match_candidate]] on [[4 March 1859|DATE]], and left on [[22 March|DATE]] for [[Aden|Aden|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] arrived [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]] on [[21 May|DATE]], discovering "My companion [[now|DATE]] stood forth in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] new colours, and angry rival."

[[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] additionally published "What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the [[Nile|Nile|alias_match_match_candidate]]" ([[1863|DATE]]), while [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s "[[Zanzibar|Zanzibar|alias_match_match_candidate]]; [[City|City|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Island|LOCATION]], and Coast" was eventually published in [[1872|DATE]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] then departed on a trip to the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[April 1860|DATE]], eventually making it to [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City|annotation]] on [[25 August|DATE]].

There [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] studied [[Mormonism|Mormonism|annotation]] and met [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] departed [[San Francisco|San Francisco|LOCATION_popular_entity]] on [[15 November|DATE]], for the voyage back to [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]], where [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] published "[[San Francisco|the city|non_person_coref]] of the Saints and Across the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountains|LOCATION_popular_entity]] to [[California|California|LOCATION_popular_entity]]".

A prolonged public quarrel followed, damaging the reputations of both [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s sympathizers contend that [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] resented [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s leadership role.

[[Tim Jeal|PERSON]], who has accessed [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s personal papers, suggests that it was more likely the other way around, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] being jealous and resentful of [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s determination and success.

[[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] had earlier proven [[John Hanning Speke|his|PERSON_coref]] mettle by trekking through [[Rocky Mountains|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s of [[Tibet|Tibet|annotation]], but [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] regarded [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] as inferior as [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] did not speak any [[Arabic|Arabic|alias_match_match_candidate]] or [[Languages of Africa|African languages|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

Despite [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] fascination with non-[[Languages of Europe|European|alias_match_single_candidate]] cultures, some have portrayed [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] as an unabashed imperialist convinced of the historical and intellectual superiority of the white race, citing [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] involvement in the [[Anthropological Society of London|Anthropological Society|annotation]], an organization that established a doctrine of scientific racism.

According to [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] broke an agreement they had made to give their [[first|ORDINAL]] public speech together.

Apart from [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s word, there is no proof that such an agreement existed, and most modern researchers doubt that it did.

[[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]], in light of the issues [[John Hanning Speke|he|PERSON_coref]] was having with [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], had [[James Augustus Grant|Grant|alias_match_single_candidate]] sign a statement saying, among other things, "I renounce all my rights to publishing ... my own account [of the expedition] until approved of by Captain [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] or [the [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society|alias_match_match_candidate]]]".

On [[16 September 1864|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] were scheduled to debate the source of the [[Nile|Nile|alias_match_match_candidate]] at a meeting of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science|annotation]].

On [[the day before|DATE]] the debate, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] sat near each other in the lecture hall.

According to [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s wife, [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]] stood up, said "I can't stand this any longer," and abruptly left the hall.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] learned of [[John Hanning Speke|Speke|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s death [[the following day|DATE]] while waiting for their debate to begin.

On [[22 January 1861|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] and Isabel married in a quiet Catholic ceremony although [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] did not adopt the Catholic faith at this time.

Shortly after this, the couple were forced to spend some time apart when [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] formally entered the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service|annotation]] as consul on [[Bioko|the island|non_person_coref]] of [[Bioko|Fernando Po|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[now|DATE]] [[Bioko|Bioko|annotation]] in [[Equatorial Guinea|Equatorial Guinea|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

This was not a prestigious appointment; because the climate was considered extremely unhealthy for Europeans, Isabel could not accompany [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] spent much of this time exploring the coast of West [[Africa|Africa|alias_match_popular_entity]], documenting [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] findings in "[[Abeokuta|LOCATION]] and The [[Western High Plateau|Cameroons Mountains|annotation]]: An Exploration" ([[1863|DATE]]), and "A Mission to [[Glele|Gelele|annotation]], King of [[Dahomey|Dahome|annotation]]" ([[1864|DATE]]).

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] described some of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] experiences, including a trip up the [[Congo River|Congo River|annotation]] to the [[Yellala Falls|Yellala Falls|annotation]] and beyond, in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[1876|DATE]] book "[[Two|NUMBER]] trips to gorilla land and the cataracts of the [[Congo River|Congo|alias_match_single_candidate]]".

The couple were reunited in [[1865|DATE]] when [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was transferred to [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos|annotation]] in [[Brazil|Brazil|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Once|DATE]] there, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] travelled through [[Brazil|Brazil|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s central highlands, canoeing down the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco River|annotation]] from its source to the falls of [[Paulo Afonso|LOCATION]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] documented [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] experiences in "The Highlands of [[Brazil|Brazil|alias_match_popular_entity]]" ([[1869|DATE]]).

In [[1868|DATE]] and [[1869|DATE]] [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] made [[two|NUMBER]] visits to [[Paraguayan War|the war|non_person_coref]] zone of the [[Paraguayan War|Paraguayan War|annotation]], which [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] described in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] "Letters from the Battlefields of [[Paraguay|Paraguay|LOCATION_popular_entity]]" ([[1870|DATE]]).

In [[1868|DATE]] [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was appointed as the [[British Army|British|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] consul in [[Damascus|Damascus|annotation]], an ideal post for someone with [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s knowledge of [[Tibet|the region|non_person_coref]] and customs.

Yet, the Turkish governor [[Mohammed Rashid 'Ali Pasha|PERSON]], feared anti-Turkish activities, and was opposed to [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s assignment.

In [[Damascus|Damascus|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] made friends with [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader al-Jazairi|annotation]], while Isabel befriended [[Jane Digby|Jane Digby|annotation]], calling [[Jane Digby|her|PERSON_coref]] "my most intimate friend."

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] also met with [[Charles Francis Tyrwhitt-Drake|Charles Francis Tyrwhitt-Drake|annotation]] and [[Edward Henry Palmer|Edward Henry Palmer|annotation]], collaborating with [[Drake|PERSON]] in writing "Unexplored [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]]" ([[1872|DATE]]).

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] did [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] best to keep the peace and resolve the situation, but this sometimes led [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] into trouble.

On [[one|NUMBER]] occasion, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] claims to have escaped an attack by hundreds of armed horsemen and camel riders sent by [[Mohammed Rashid Pasha|PERSON]], the Governor of [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] eventually suffered the enmity

Then, [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] involvement with the [[Sházlis|PERSON]], a group of [[Muslims|Muslims|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] called "Secret Christians longing for baptism," which Isabel called "[[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] ruin."

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] was recalled in [[August 1871|DATE]], prompting [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] to telegram Isabel "I am recalled. Pay, pack, and follow at convenience."

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was reassigned in [[1872|DATE]] to the sleepy port city of [[Trieste|Trieste|annotation]] in [[Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary|annotation]].

A "broken man", [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was never particularly content with this post, but it required little work, was far less dangerous than [[Damascus|Damascus|alias_match_match_candidate]] (as well as less exciting), and allowed [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] the freedom to write and travel.

In [[1863|DATE]] [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] co-founded the [[Anthropological Society of London|Anthropological Society of London|annotation]] with Dr. [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt|annotation]].

In [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical "Anthropologia") was "to supply travellers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters".

On [[13 February 1886|DATE]], [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George|Order of St Michael and St George|annotation]] ([[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG|alias_match_single_candidate]]) by [[Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] wrote a number of travel books in this period that were not particularly well received.

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqué or even pornographic at the [[time|DATE]], which were published under the auspices of the Kama Shastra society.

Published in this period but composed on [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] return journey from [[Mecca|Mecca|alias_match_match_candidate]], "[[The Kasidah|The Kasidah|annotation]]" has been cited as evidence of [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s status as a Bektashi [[Sufism|Sufi|annotation]].

Deliberately presented by [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] as a translation, the poem and [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] notes and commentary on it contain layers of [[Sufism|Sufic|alias_match_single_candidate]] meaning

"Do what thy manhood bids thee do/ from none but self expect applause;/ [[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] noblest lives and noblest dies/ who makes and keeps [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] self-made laws"" is "The Kasidahs most-quoted passage. As well as references to many themes from Classical Western myths, the poem contains many laments that are accented with fleeting imagery such as repeated comparisons to ""the tinkling of the Camel bell"" that becomes inaudible as the animal vanishes in the darkness of the desert.

Other works of note include a collection of [[Hindus|Hindu|alias_match_popular_redirect]] tales, "Vikram and the Vampire" ([[1870|DATE]]); and [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] uncompleted history of swordsmanship, "The [[Quran|Book|alias_match_single_candidate]] of the Sword" ([[1884|DATE]]).

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] also translated "[[Os Lusíadas|The Lusiads|annotation]]", the Portuguese national epic by [[Luís de Camões|Luís de Camões|annotation]], in [[1880|DATE]] and, [[the next year|DATE]], wrote a sympathetic biography of the poet and adventurer.

([[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s investigations into this had provoked hostility from the Jewish population in [[Damascus|Damascus|alias_match_match_candidate]] (see the [[Damascus affair|Damascus affair|annotation]]).

The manuscript of the book included an appendix discussing the topic in more detail, but by the decision of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] widow, it was not included in the book when published).

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] died in [[Trieste|Trieste|annotation]] [[early on the morning of 20|TIME]] [[October 1890|DATE]] of a heart attack.

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] wife Isabel persuaded a priest to perform the last rites, although [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was not a Catholic, and this action later caused a rift between [[Isabel|ORGANIZATION]] and some of [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s friends.

It has been suggested that the death occurred very [[late on 19 October|DATE]] and that [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] was already dead by the time the last rites were administered.

On [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] religious views, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] called himself an atheist, stating [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was raised in the [[Church of England|Church of England|annotation]] which [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] said was "officially ([[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]]) church".

After [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] death [[Queen Victoria|she|PERSON_coref]] burned many of [[Queen Victoria|her|PERSON_coref]] husband's papers, including journals and a planned new translation of "[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden|annotation]]" to be called "The Scented Garden", for which [[Queen Victoria|she|PERSON_coref]] had been offered [[six thousand|NUMBER]] guineas and which [[Queen Victoria|she|PERSON_coref]] regarded as [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] "magnum opus".

[[Queen Victoria|She|PERSON_coref]] believed [[Queen Victoria|she|PERSON_coref]] was acting to protect [[Queen Victoria|her|PERSON_coref]] husband's reputation, and that [[Queen Victoria|she|PERSON_coref]] had been instructed to burn the manuscript of "The Scented Garden" by [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] spirit, but [[Queen Victoria|her|PERSON_coref]] actions were controversial.

However, a substantial quantity of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] written materials have survived, and are held by the [[Huntington Library|LOCATION]] in [[San Marino|San Marino|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[California|California|LOCATION_popular_entity]], including [[21|NUMBER]] boxes of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] manuscripts, [[24|NUMBER]] boxes of correspondence, and other material (https://catalog.huntington.org/record=b1707757).

The coffins of [[Sir|Sir|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard|alias_match_article_entity]] and Lady [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] can be seen through a window at the rear of the tent, which can be accessed via a short fixed ladder.

Next to the lady chapel in the church there is a memorial stained-glass window to [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], also erected by [[Isabel|LOCATION]]; it depicts [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] as a [[medieval|DATE]] knight.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s personal effects and a collection of paintings, photographs and objects relating to [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] are in the [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] Collection at [[Orleans House|Orleans House Gallery|annotation]], [[Twickenham|Twickenham|annotation]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] had long had an interest in sexuality and some erotic literature.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] referred to the society and those who shared its views as "[[Mrs Grundy|Mrs Grundy|annotation]]".

For this reason [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], together with [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot|PERSON]], created the [[Kama Shastra Society|ORGANIZATION]] to print and circulate books that would be illegal to publish in public.

[[One Thousand and One Nights|One|NUMBER_part_of_seen_entity]] of the most celebrated of all [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] books is [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] translation of "[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night|The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night|annotation]]" (commonly called "[[One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights|annotation]]" in [[East India Company|English|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] after early translations of [[Antoine Galland|Antoine Galland|annotation]]'s French version) in [[ten|NUMBER]] volumes ([[1885|DATE]]), with [[seven|NUMBER]] further volumes being added later.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] speculated that male homosexuality was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] the "Sotadic zone".

Perhaps [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s best-known book is [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] translation of "[[Kama Sutra|The Kama Sutra|annotation]]".

It is untrue that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was the translator since the original manuscript was in ancient [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit|annotation]], which [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] could not read.

However, [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] collaborated with [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot|PERSON]] on the work and provided translations from other manuscripts of later translations.

The [[Kama Shastra Society|ORGANIZATION]] [[first|ORDINAL]] printed the book in [[1883|DATE]] and numerous editions of the [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] translation are in print to [[this day|DATE]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] [[East India Company|English|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] translation from a French edition of the [[Arabic|Arabic|alias_match_match_candidate]] erotic guide "[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden|annotation]]" was printed as "[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden of the Cheikh Nefzaoui|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]: A Manual of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Erotology" ([[1886|DATE]]).

After [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s death, [[Isabel Burton|Isabel|annotation]] burnt many of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] papers, including a manuscript of a subsequent translation, "The Scented Garden", containing the final chapter of the work, on pederasty.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] all along intended for this translation to be published after [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] death, to provide an income for [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] widow.

" title = [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s languages

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s writings are unusually open and frank about [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] interest in sex and sexuality.

[[Richard Francis Burton|His|PERSON_coref]] travel writing is often full of details about the sexual lives of the inhabitants of areas [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] travelled through.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s interest in sexuality led [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]] to make measurements of the lengths of the penises of male inhabitants of various regions, which [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] includes in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] travel books.

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] also describes sexual techniques common in [[California|the region|non_person_coref]]s [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] visited, often hinting that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had participated, hence breaking both sexual and racial taboos of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[day|DURATION]].

Biographers disagree on whether or not [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] ever experienced homosexual sex ([[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] never directly acknowledges it in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] writing).

Allegations began in [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] army [[days|DURATION]] when [[Charles James Napier|Charles James Napier|annotation]] requested that [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] go undercover to investigate a male brothel reputed to be frequented by [[British Army|British soldiers|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

It has been suggested that [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s detailed report on the workings of the brothel led some to believe [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had been a customer.

There is no documentary evidence that such a report was written or submitted, nor that [[Charles James Napier|Napier|alias_match_single_candidate]] ordered such research by [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], and it has been argued that this is [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s embellishments.

A story that haunted [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] up to [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] death (recounted in some of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] obituaries) was that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] came close to being discovered [[one|NUMBER]] [[night|TIME]] when [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] lifted [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] robe to urinate rather than squatting as an [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]] would.

It was said that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was seen by an [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]] and, to avoid exposure, killed [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] being discovered as an impostor.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] became so tired of denying this accusation that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] took to baiting [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] accusers, although [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was said to enjoy the notoriety and even [[once|DATE]] laughingly claimed to have done it.

A doctor [[once|DATE]] asked [[Richard Francis Burton|him|PERSON_coref]]: "How do you feel when you have killed a man?"

, [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] retorted: "Quite jolly, what about you?"

When asked by a priest about the same incident [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] is said to have replied: "[[Sir|Sir|alias_match_popular_entity]], I'm proud to say I have committed every sin in the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue|annotation]]."

[[Stanley Lane-Poole|Stanley Lane-Poole|annotation]], a [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] detractor, reported that [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] "confessed rather shamefacedly that [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had never killed anybody at any time."

These allegations coupled with [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]]'s often irascible nature were said to have harmed [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] career and may explain why [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was not promoted further, either in army life or in the diplomatic service.

As an obituary described: "...[[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was ill fitted to run in official harness, and [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had a [[Lord Byron|Byronic|annotation]] love of shocking people, of telling tales against himself that had no foundation in fact."

[[Ouida|Ouida|annotation]] reported: "Men at the FO [[[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|Foreign Office|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]]] ... used to hint dark horrors about [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]], and certainly justly or unjustly [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was disliked, feared and suspected ... not for what [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] had done, but for what [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] was believed capable of doing."

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] theorized about the existence of a Sotadic Zone in the closing essay of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[East India Company|English|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] translation of "[[One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights|annotation]]" ([[1885|DATE]]–[[1886|DATE]]).

[[Richard Francis Burton|He|PERSON_coref]] asserted that there exists a geographic-climatic zone in which sodomy and pederasty (sexual intimacy between older men and young pubescent/adolescent boys) are endemic, prevalent, and celebrated among the indigenous inhabitants and within their cultures.

[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton|alias_match_article_entity]] [[first|ORDINAL]] advanced [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] Sotadic Zone concept in the "Terminal Essay", contained in Volume [[10|NUMBER]] of [[Richard Francis Burton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[East India Company|English|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] translation of "[[One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights|annotation]]", which [[Richard Francis Burton|he|PERSON_coref]] called "[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night|The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night|annotation]]", published in [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] in [[1886|DATE]].

[[Volodymyr Vynnychenko|His|PERSON_coref]] [[second|ORDINAL]] government was confirmed by [[Alexander Kerensky|Alexander Kerensky|annotation]] on [[September 1|DATE]].

It is often claimed that the political mistakes of [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko|Vynnychenko|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Mykhailo Hrushevsky|annotation]] cost the newly established [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian People's Republic|annotation]] its independence.

Around then, [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko|Vynnychenko|alias_match_article_entity]]'s government established an economic agreement with the government of the [[Belarusian People's Republic|Belarus People's Republic|annotation]] through the [[Belarus|Belarus|alias_match_popular_entity]] Chamber of Commerce in [[Kyiv|Kiev|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

This actions produced a split in the Foreign Group of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Communism|Communist|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Party: some remained pro-[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and indeed returned to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]; others supported [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko|Vynnychenko|alias_match_article_entity]], and with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko|him|PERSON_coref]] conducted a campaign against the [[Soviet Union|Soviet|alias_match_popular_redirect]] regime in their organ "Nova Doba" ("New Era").

Messali Hadj

[[Messali Hadj|Ahmed Ben Messali Hadj|annotation]] ([[May 16, 1898|DATE]] - [[June 3, 1974|DATE]]), commonly known as [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|annotation]], [[مصالي الحاج|NUMBER]], was an [[Algeria|Algeria|annotation]]n nationalist politician dedicated to the independence of [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] homeland from [[French colonial empire|French colonial rule|annotation]].

[[Messali Hadj|He|PERSON_coref]] is often called the "father" of [[Algeria|Algerian|alias_match_single_candidate]] nationalism.

[[Messali Hadj|He|PERSON_coref]] co-founded the "[[Étoile Nord-Africaine|Étoile nord-africaine|annotation]]", and founded the "Parti du peuple algérien" and the "Mouvement pour le triomphe des libertés démocratiques" before dissociating himself from the armed struggle for Independence in [[1954|DATE]].

[[Messali Hadj|He|PERSON_coref]] also founded the "Mouvement national algérien" to counteract the ongoing efforts of the "[[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de libération nationale|annotation]]".

Ahmed Ben [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[Tlemcen|Tlemcen|annotation]] in [[1898|DATE]].

[[Messali Hadj|His|PERSON_coref]] father [[Hadj Ahmed Messali|PERSON]] was of [[Turkish people|Turkish|annotation]] origin and [[Hadj Ahmed Messali|his|PERSON_coref]] mother [[Ftéma Sari Ali Hadj-Eddine|PERSON]] belonged to a family of [[seven|NUMBER]] daughters, raised in Muslim traditions by their father, a cadi, a member of the [[Darqawiyya brotherhood|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] served in the [[French Communist Party|French|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] army from [[1918|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1921|DATE]]; having trained in [[Bordeaux|Bordeaux|annotation]] and then promoted as sergeant in [[1919|DATE]].

By [[October 1923|DATE]], at the age of [[25|NUMBER]], [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] went to [[Paris|Paris|annotation]] to find work; upon [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] arrival, [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] sold bonnets and Tlemceni handicrafts, and [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] also enrolled in Arabic-language university courses.

During [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] time in [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] met [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] [[French Communist Party|French|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] wife, [[Émilie Busquant|Émilie Busquant|annotation]], a worker revolutionary’s daughter.

[[Messali Hadj|His|PERSON_coref]] time in [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_match_candidate]] also corresponded with the [[first|ORDINAL]] meetings of Maghribi workers in [[France|France|alias_match_popular_entity]] which called for the independence of all colonies.

Abdelkader [[Hadj Ali|PERSON]] recruited [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] to the [[French Communist Party|French Communist Party|annotation]] ([[French Communist Party|PCF|alias_match_single_candidate]]) colonial commission in [[1925|DATE]].

In [[1926|DATE]] [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] founded the ""[[Étoile Nord-Africaine|Étoile Nord-Africaine|annotation]]"" (ENA).

Consequently, [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] became [[one|NUMBER]] of the most prominent [[Algeria|Algerian|alias_match_single_candidate]] nationalists seeking to remove all [[French Communist Party|French|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] forces and to end [[French colonial empire|French colonial rule|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[Algeria|Algeria|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Messal Hadj went to [[Brussels|Brussels|annotation]] in [[1927|DATE]] to outline the [[ENA|ORGANIZATION]]’s demands for the abolition of the "[[Indigénat|Indigénat|annotation]]" and amnesty for all those convicted under it; moreover, [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] listed several other demands including: the right to form trade unions, education for all, and social welfare and representational legislation.

Thereafter, [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] rebranded the [[ENA|ORGANIZATION]] several times in [[the 1930s|DATE]] and [[1940s|DATE]]; hence, [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] would find himself frequently jailed or exiled.

By 1935 [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] reorganised the ""[[Étoile Nord-Africaine|Étoile Nord-Africaine|annotation]]"" (ENA) party and distanced it from the [[French Communist Party|French communists|alias_match_single_candidate]] by presenting it as an [[Algeria|Algerian|alias_match_single_candidate]] nationalist organisation called the ""Union Nationale des Musulmans Nord-Africains"".

However, whilst [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] was in temporary exile in [[Geneva|Geneva|annotation]], [[Switzerland|Switzerland|annotation]], [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] met [[Shakib Arslan|Shakib Arslan|annotation]] and reoriented from [[Marxism|Marxism|annotation]] to [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabism|annotation]] and [[Islamism|Islamism|annotation]].

Consequently, [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] reorganised [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] nationalist movement as the ""[[Parti du Peuple Algérien"|Parti du Peuple Algérien"|acronym_entity]]" ([[Parti du Peuple Algérien"|PPA|acronym]]) in March 1937.

However, in [[March 1941|DATE]] [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] was tried by a [[Vichy France|Vichy|annotation]] court and sentenced to [[16 years|DURATION]] of hard labour.

[[Messali Hadj|He|PERSON_coref]] was confined [[first|ORDINAL]] to southern [[Algeria|Algeria|alias_match_match_candidate]] and then in [[Brazzaville|Brazzaville|annotation]] in [[French Equatorial Africa|French Equatorial Africa|annotation]].

Nonetheless, [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] continued to be active in the [[Algeria|Algerian|alias_match_single_candidate]] nationalist movement.

[[Once|DATE]] [[World War II|World War II|annotation]] came to an end, [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] was amnestied and returned to [[Algeria|Algeria|alias_match_match_candidate]].

However, straining relations between the ""Parti du Peuple Algérien"" and the ""[[Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté"|Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté"|acronym_entity]]" ([[Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté"|AML|acronym]]), as well as the decision to arrest and deport [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]], contributed to the outbreak of riots in [[Sétif|Sétif|annotation]] and Constantinois on [[May 8, 1945|DATE]].

[[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] had been exiled to [[Brazzaville|Brazzaville|alias_match_match_candidate]] as soon as [[Vichy France|French authorities|alias_match_single_candidate]] received word of plans by "Parti du Peuple Algérien" to escalate the deepening unrest between the [[Vichy France|French|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] settler "colons" and the [[Muslims|Muslims|alias_match_popular_entity]].

By 1946 [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] founded the ""Mouvement pour le triomphe des libertés démocratiques"" (MTLD) to replace the [[Parti du Peuple Algérien"|PPA|acronym_ner]], which had been outlawed by the [[Vichy France|French authorities|alias_match_single_candidate]].

However, [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]]'s assertion of [[Pan-Arabism|Arabism|annotation]] alienated the [[Kabyle people|Kabyles|annotation]] and contributed to the Berberist crisis in [[1949|DATE]].

[[Once|DATE]] the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Liberation|annotation]] began, [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] sought to compete with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale|annotation]] by mobilising the [[Mouvement National Algérien|Mouvement National Algérien|acronym_entity]] ([[Mouvement National Algérien|MNA|acronym]]) in December 1954.

After the outbreak of the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence|annotation]] in [[1954|DATE]] which was started against [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] wishes, [[Messali Hadj|Messali|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] created the [[Mouvement National Algérien|ORGANIZATION]], or MNA ([[French language|French|annotation]] "[[Algerian War|Algerian|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] National Movement").

Messali's followers clashed with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN|alias_match_single_candidate]]; [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] was the only socialist faction not absorbed into the Front's fight for independence.

In [[1958|DATE]], [[Messali Hadj|Messali|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] supported the proposals of President [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle|annotation]], and [[France|France|alias_match_popular_entity]] probably attempted to capitalize on the internal rivalries of the nationalist movement.

In [[1962|DATE]], as [[Algeria|Algeria|alias_match_match_candidate]] gained independence from [[France|France|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Messali Hadj|Messali|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] tried to transform [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] group into a legitimate political party, but it was not successful, and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN|alias_match_single_candidate]] seized control over [[Algeria|Algeria|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a one-party state.

[[Messali Hadj|He|PERSON_coref]] was married to [[Émilie Busquant|Émilie Busquant|annotation]], a [[French language|French|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] feminist, anarcho-syndicalist and anti-colonial activist.

[[Messali Hadj|His|PERSON_coref]] daughter, [[Djanina Messali-Benkelfat|PERSON]], published a book about [[her|PERSON]] father called ""Une vie partagée avec [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]], [[mon|DATE]] père"" ("A Life Shared with [[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]], my Father").

[[Messali Hadj|Messali Hadj|alias_match_article_entity]] was in exile in [[France|France|annotation]] when [[Messali Hadj|he|PERSON_coref]] died in [[1974|DATE]].

[[Messali Hadj|His|PERSON_coref]] body was buried in [[Messali Hadj|his|PERSON_coref]] native [[Tlemcen|Tlemcen|annotation]].

Whilst some historians consider [[Bede|him|PERSON_coref]] to have been Danish, as depicted on [[Walcott, Norfolk|the village|non_person_coref]] sign at [[Happisburgh|Happisburgh|alias_match_match_candidate]], all (admittedly slender) evidence relating to [[Bede|his|PERSON_coref]] origin suggests that [[Bede|he|PERSON_coref]] was [[Angles|English|alias_match_single_candidate]].

Immediately after the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Walcott, Norfolk|Walcott|alias_match_article_entity]] was given to [[Robert Malet|Robert Malet|annotation]] who died before the [[Domesday Survey of|DATE]] [[1088|DATE]] when it was granted to [[Ralph|PERSON]] ([[Ranulf|ORGANIZATION]]), brother of [[Iger|PERSON]] and held by [[Humphrey|PERSON]], possibly [[Humphrey|his|PERSON_coref]] nephew.

Viking Age

The [[Viking Age|Viking Age|annotation]] ([[793|NUMBER]]–[[1066 AD|DATE]]) was the period during the [[Middle Ages|Middle Ages|annotation]] when [[Norsemen|Norsemen|annotation]] known as [[Vikings|Vikings|annotation]] undertook large-scale raiding, colonizing, conquest and trading throughout [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]], and reached [[North America|North America|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] applies not only to their homeland of [[Scandinavia|Scandinavia|annotation]], but to any place significantly settled by [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavians|annotation]] during the period.

The [[Norsemen|Scandinavians|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] are often referred to as "[[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]]" as well as "[[Norsemen|Norsemen|alias_match_match_candidate]]", although few of them were [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] in the technical sense.

[[Norsemen|The Norse|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] homelands were also unified into larger kingdoms during the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]], and the short-lived [[North Sea Empire|North Sea Empire|annotation]] included large swathes of [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

Sailing innovations had allowed the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] to sail further and longer to begin with.

Information about the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] is drawn largely from primary sources written by those the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] encountered, as well as archaeology, supplemented with secondary sources such as the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic Sagas|annotation]].

In [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] attack of [[8 June|DATE]] [[793|NUMBER]] that destroyed the abbey on [[Lindisfarne|Lindisfarne|annotation]], a centre of learning on an island off the northeast coast of [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[Northumberland|Northumberland|annotation]], is regarded as the beginning of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Three|NUMBER]] [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] ships had beached in [[Weymouth Bay|Weymouth Bay|annotation]] [[four years earlier|DATE]] (although due to a scribal error the "[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|annotation]]" dates this event to [[787|NUMBER]] rather than [[789|NUMBER]]), but that incursion may have been a trading expedition that went wrong rather than a piratical raid.

The [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] devastation of [[Northumbria|Northumbria|annotation]]'s [[Lindisfarne|Holy Island|alias_match_single_candidate]] was reported by the [[Northumbria|Northumbrian|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] scholar [[Alcuin|Alcuin of York|annotation]], who wrote: "Never before in [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] has such a terror appeared".

[[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies.

The [[first|ORDINAL]] challenges to the many anti-[[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] images in [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] emerged in [[the 17th century|DATE]].

Pioneering scholarly works on the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] reached a small readership in [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

Linguistics traced the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

New dictionaries of the Old [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] language enabled more Victorians to read the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic Sagas|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

In [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]], the 17th-century [[Vikings|Danish|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] scholars [[Thomas Bartholin|Thomas Bartholin|annotation]] and [[Ole Worm|Ole Worm|annotation]] and [[Sweden|Swedish|alias_match_single_candidate]] scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck|Olaus Rudbeck|annotation]] were the [[first|ORDINAL]] to use runic inscriptions and [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic Sagas|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] as primary historical sources.

By the latter half of the [[Age of Enlightenment|18th|alias_match_single_candidate]] century, while the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic saga|annotation]]s were still used as important historical sources, the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic countries|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Scholars outside [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] until [[the 1890s|DATE]], recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.

Until [[recently|DATE]], the history of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] had largely been based on [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic Sagas|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes|annotation]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo Grammaticus|annotation]], the [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus'|annotation]]s "[[Primary Chronicle|Primary Chronicle|annotation]]", and "[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib|Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib|annotation]]".

In [[the eighth century|DATE]], [[Norsemen|Scandinavians|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

Many theories are posited for the cause of the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role.

Tensions caused by [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish|alias_match_single_candidate]] expansion to the south of [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]], and their subsequent attacks upon the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] peoples, may have also played a role in [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] pillaging.

;Demographic model: This model suggests that [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] experienced a population boom just before the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] began.

;Economic model: The economic model states that the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] was the result of growing urbanism and trade throughout mainland [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]].

The [[Norsemen|Scandinavians|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier "urban" centres, which soon became frequent targets of [[Viking Age|Viking raids|alias_match_article_entity]].

The connection of the [[Norsemen|Scandinavians|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] to larger and richer trade networks lured the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] into Western [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]], and soon the rest of [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]] and parts of the [[Middle East|Middle East|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]], hoards of [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard|Cuerdale Hoard|annotation]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard|Vale of York Hoard|annotation]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.

The start of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]], with the sack of [[Lindisfarne|Lindisfarne|alias_match_match_candidate]], also coincided with [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne|annotation]]'s [[Saxon Wars|Saxon Wars|annotation]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony|annotation]].

[[Bruno Dumézil|PERSON]] theorises that the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] attacks may have been in response to the spread of Christianity among pagan peoples.

The [[second|ORDINAL]] case is the internal "Push" factor, which coincides with a period just before the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] in which [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of [[Denmark|Denmark|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Sweden|Sweden|alias_match_match_candidate]], and especially [[Norway|Norway|alias_match_match_candidate]].

;Technological model: This model suggests that the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] occurred as a result of technological innovations that allowed the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] to go on their raids in the [[first|ORDINAL]] place.

There is no doubt that piracy existed in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic|alias_match_single_candidate]] before the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]], but developments in sailing technology and practice made it possible for early [[Vikings|Viking raiders|alias_match_single_candidate]] to attack lands farther away.

The earliest date given for a [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] raid is [[789|NUMBER]], when according to the "[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|annotation]]", a group of [[Danes|Danes|alias_match_popular_entity]] sailed to the [[Isle of Portland|Isle of Portland|annotation]] in [[Dorset|Dorset|annotation]] (it was wrongly recorded as [[787|NUMBER]]).

The beginning of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] in the [[British Isles|British Isles|annotation]] is often set at [[793|NUMBER]].

Near the end of [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s reign (and throughout the reigns of [[Charlemagne|his|PERSON_coref]] sons and grandsons), a string of [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] raids began, culminating in a gradual [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] conquest and settlement of [[Middle East|the region|non_person_coref]] [[now|DATE]] known as [[Normandy|Normandy|alias_match_popular_entity]].

They extended the reach of [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Whenever these [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] ships ran aground in shallow waters, the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.

In [[884|NUMBER]], an army of [[Vikings|Danish Vikings|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi|Battle of Norditi|annotation]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea|North Sea|annotation]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian|annotation]] army under [[Archbishop Rimbert of Bremen-Hamburg|ORGANIZATION]], which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] from [[East Frisia|East Frisia|annotation]].

In [[911|NUMBER]], French King [[Charles the Simple|Charles the Simple|annotation]] was able to make an agreement with the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] warleader [[Rollo|Rollo|annotation]], a chieftain of disputed [[Norway|Norwegian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] or [[Denmark|Danish|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] origins.

In return, [[Rollo|Rollo|alias_match_match_candidate]] swore fealty to [[Charles the Simple|Charles|alias_match_single_line_candidate]], converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]] against the incursions of other [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] groups.

Several generations later, the [[Norman Conquest|Norman|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] descendants of these [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] settlers not only identified themselves as [[Norman Conquest|Norman|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]], but also carried the [[Norman language|Norman language|annotation]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance|annotation]] language with Germanic influence), and their [[Norman Conquest|Norman|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] culture, into [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] in [[1066|DATE]].

In [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]], the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.

The end of the [[Viking Age|Viking era|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Norway|Norway|alias_match_match_candidate]] is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad|Battle of Stiklestad|annotation]] in [[1030|DATE]].

[[Norwegians|Norwegians|alias_match_popular_entity]] would no longer be called [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]].

In [[Sweden|Sweden|alias_match_match_candidate]], the reign of king [[Olof Skötkonung|Olov Skötkonung|annotation]] is considered to be the transition from the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] to the [[Middle Ages|Middle Ages|alias_match_match_candidate]], because [[Olof Skötkonung|he|PERSON_coref]] was the [[first|ORDINAL]] Christian king of the [[Swedes|Swedes|alias_match_popular_entity]], and [[Olof Skötkonung|he|PERSON_coref]] is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is [[today|DATE]] southwestern and central [[Sweden|Sweden|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] beliefs persisted until the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|12th century|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Olof Skötkonung|Olof|alias_match_single_candidate]] being the last king in [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

The end of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] is traditionally marked in [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] by the failed invasion attempted by the [[Norway|Norwegian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] king [[Harald Hardrada|Harald|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Harðráði|annotation]]), who was defeated by [[Saxons|Saxon|alias_match_popular_redirect]] King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold Godwinson|annotation]] in [[1066|DATE]] at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|Battle of Stamford Bridge|annotation]]; in [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]], the capture of [[Dublin|Dublin|annotation]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow|annotation]] and [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman|annotation]] forces in [[1171|DATE]]; and [[1263|DATE]] in [[Scotland|Scotland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Hákon Hákonarson|annotation]] at the [[Battle of Largs|Battle of Largs|annotation]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III|annotation]].

[[Harold Godwinson|Godwinson|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was subsequently defeated within [[a month|DURATION]] by another [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] descendant, [[William the Conqueror|William|annotation]], Duke of [[Normandy|Normandy|annotation]].

The raid marked the beginning of the "[[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] of Invasion".

[[The following year|DATE]], the [[Great Heathen Army|Great Heathen Army|annotation]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless|Ivar the Boneless|annotation]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan|annotation]] and [[Ubba|Ubba|annotation]]), and also by another [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Guthrum|Guthrum|annotation]], arrived in [[East Frisia|East|alias_match_single_candidate]] Anglia.

They proceeded to cross [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] into [[Northumbria|Northumbria|alias_match_match_candidate]] and captured [[York|York|alias_match_popular_entity]], establishing a [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] community in [[Scandinavian York|Jorvik|annotation]], where some settled as farmers and craftsmen.

Most of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]].

By [[870|NUMBER]], the "[[Great Heathen Army|Great Summer Army|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]" arrived in [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]], led by a [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] leader called [[Bagsecg|Bagsecg|annotation]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|his|PERSON_coref]] [[five|NUMBER]] earls.

Aided by the [[Great Heathen Army|Great Heathen Army|alias_match_match_candidate]] (which had already overrun much of [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] from its base in [[Scandinavian York|Jorvik|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]), [[Bagsecg|Bagsecg|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s forces, and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s forces (through an alliance), the combined [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] forces raided much of [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] until [[871|NUMBER]], when they planned an invasion of [[Wessex|ORGANIZATION]].

As a result, many of the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to northern [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]], where [[Jorvic|PERSON]] had become the centre of the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex|annotation]] managed to keep them out of [[Alfred the Great|his|PERSON_coref]] country.

[[Alfred the Great|Alfred|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Alfred the Great|his|PERSON_coref]] successors continued to drive back the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] frontier and take [[York|York|alias_match_popular_entity]].

A new wave of [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] appeared in [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] in [[947|NUMBER]], when [[Eric Bloodaxe|Eric Bloodaxe|annotation]] captured [[York|York|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Harold Harefoot|Harold Harefoot|annotation]] became king of [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] after [[Cnut the Great|Cnut|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s death, and [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] rule of [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] ceased.

The [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] presence declined until [[1066|DATE]], when they lost their final battle with the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] at [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|Stamford Bridge|annotation]].

The death in [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|the battle|non_person_coref]] of [[William the Conqueror|King|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Harald Hardrada|Harald Hardrada|annotation]] of [[Norway|Norway|alias_match_match_candidate]] ended any hope of reviving [[Cnut the Great|Cnut|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s [[North Sea Empire|North Sea Empire|annotation]], and it is because of this, rather than the [[Norman Conquest|Norman conquest|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], that [[1066|DATE]] is often taken as the end of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

In [[795|NUMBER]], small bands of [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] began plundering monastic settlements along the coast of [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic Ireland|annotation]].

The [[Annals of Ulster|Annals of Ulster|annotation]] state that in [[821|NUMBER]] the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] plundered [[Howth|Howth|annotation]] and "carried off a great number of women into captivity".

From [[840|NUMBER]] the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] began building fortified encampments, "longphorts", on the coast and overwintering in [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] chief [[Turgesius|Thorgest|annotation]] is said to have raided the whole midlands of [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]] until [[Turgesius|he|PERSON_coref]] was killed by [[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid|Máel Sechnaill I|annotation]] in [[845|NUMBER]].

In [[853|NUMBER]], [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] leader [[Amlaíb Conung|Amlaíb|annotation]] ([[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]) became the [[first|ORDINAL]] king of Dublin.

Over [[the following decades|DATE]], there was regular warfare between the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] and the [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish|alias_match_single_candidate]], and between [[two|NUMBER]] groups of [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]]: the [[Dubgaill and Finngaill|Dubgaill and Finngaill|annotation]] (dark and fair foreigners).

In [[866|NUMBER]], [[Áed Findliath|Áed Findliath|annotation]] burnt all [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] longphorts in the north, and they never managed to establish permanent settlements in that region.

During [[the next eight years|DURATION]] the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] won decisive battles against the [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish|alias_match_single_candidate]], regained control of [[Dublin|Dublin|alias_match_match_candidate]], and founded settlements at [[Waterford|Waterford|annotation]], [[Wexford|Wexford|annotation]], [[Cork (city)|Cork|annotation]] and [[Limerick|Limerick|annotation]], which became [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] large towns.

These [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] territories became part of the patchwork of kingdoms in [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] intermarried with the [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish|alias_match_single_candidate]] and adopted elements of [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish|alias_match_single_candidate]] culture, becoming the [[Norse–Gaels|Norse-Gaels|annotation]].

Some [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] kings of [[Dublin|Dublin|alias_match_match_candidate]] also ruled [[Charlemagne|the king|non_person_coref]]dom of the [[Hebrides|Isles|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Scandinavian York|York|annotation]]; such as [[Sitric Cáech|Sitric Cáech|annotation]], [[Gofraid ua Ímair|Gofraid ua Ímair|annotation]], [[Olaf Guthfrithson|Olaf Guthfrithson|annotation]] and [[Amlaíb Cuarán|Olaf Cuaran|annotation]].

In [[980|NUMBER]], [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill|Máel Sechnaill Mór|annotation]] defeated the [[Dublin|Dublin|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] and forced them into submission.

Over [[the following thirty years|DURATION]], [[Brian Boru|Brian Boru|annotation]] subdued the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] territories and made himself [[High King of Ireland|High King of Ireland|annotation]].

The [[Dublin|Dublin|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]], together with [[Leinster|Leinster|LOCATION_popular_entity]], twice rebelled against [[High King of Ireland|him|PERSON_coref]], but they were defeated in [[Battle of Hastings|the battle|non_person_coref]]s of [[Battle of Glenmama|Glenmama|annotation]] ([[999|NUMBER]]) and [[Battle of Clontarf|Clontarf|annotation]] ([[1014|DATE]]).

After [[Battle of Clontarf|the battle|non_person_coref]] of [[Battle of Clontarf|Clontarf|alias_match_single_candidate]], the [[Dublin|Dublin|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] could no longer "single-handedly threaten the power of the most powerful kings of [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]]".

[[Brian Boru|Brian|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s rise to power and conflict with the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] is chronicled in "[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib|Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib|annotation]]" ("[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib|The War of the Irish with the Foreigners|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]").

While few records are known, the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] are thought to have led their [[first|ORDINAL]] raids in [[Scotland|Scotland|annotation]] on the holy island of [[Iona|Iona|annotation]] in [[794|NUMBER]], [[the year|DATE]] following the raid on the other holy island of [[Lindisfarne|Lindisfarne|annotation]], [[Northumbria|Northumbria|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In [[839|NUMBER]], a large [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] fleet invaded via the [[River Tay|River Tay|annotation]] and [[River Earn|River Earn|annotation]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom|annotation]] of [[Fortriu|Fortriu|annotation]].

In [[870|NUMBER]], the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North|annotation]] around the [[Firth of Clyde|Firth of Clyde|annotation]] came under [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] attack as well.

The fortress atop [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Alt Clut|annotation]] ("Rock of the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde|alias_match_single_candidate]]," the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic|annotation]] name for [[Dumbarton Castle|Dumbarton Rock|annotation]], which had become the metonym for their kingdom) was besieged by the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] kings [[Amlaíb Conung|Amlaíb|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and [[Ímar|Ímar|annotation]].

The land that [[now|DATE]] comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands|Scottish Lowlands|annotation]] had [[previously|DATE]] been the northernmost part of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon|alias_match_popular_redirect]] kingdom of [[Northumbria|Northumbria|alias_match_match_candidate]], which fell apart with its [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] conquest; these lands were never regained by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxons|alias_match_popular_entity]], or [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]].

The upheaval and pressure of [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day [[Scotland|Scotland|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Over the subsequent [[300 years|DURATION]], this [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the [[previously|DATE]] contending [[Norse–Gaels|Gaelic|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], [[Picts|Pictish|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[British Isles|British|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], and [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] kingdoms, [[first|ORDINAL]] into the [[Kingdom of Alba|Kingdom of Alba|annotation]], and finally into the greater [[Kingdom of Scotland|Kingdom of Scotland|annotation]].

The [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Scotland|Scotland|alias_match_match_candidate]] came to an end after [[another 100 years|DURATION]].

The last vestiges of [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] power in the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] seas and islands were completely relinquished after [[another 200 years|DURATION]].

The end of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] "proper" in [[Scotland|Scotland|alias_match_match_candidate]] is generally considered to be in [[1266|DATE]].

[[Battle of Clontarf|the battle|non_person_coref]] proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] were not able to mount a further attack that [[year|DURATION]].

Wales was not colonised by the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] as heavily as eastern [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]].

According to [[Sagas of Icelanders|Sagas|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], [[Iceland|Iceland|alias_match_popular_entity]] was discovered by [[Naddodd|ORGANIZATION]], a [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] from the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands|alias_match_match_candidate]], after which it was settled by mostly [[Norwegians|Norwegians|alias_match_popular_entity]] fleeing the oppressive rule of [[Harald Fairhair|Harald Fairhair|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[985|NUMBER]].

While harsh, the land allowed for a pastoral farming life familiar to the [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]].

Kvenland, known as [[Cwenland|LOCATION]], [[Kænland|LOCATION]], and similar terms in [[medieval|DATE]] sources, is an ancient name for an area in [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Fennoscandia|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Viking Age in Estonia|Estonia|annotation]] was not a unified country during the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]], and [[Ayrshire|the area|non_person_coref]] of [[Ancient Estonia|Ancient Estonia|annotation]] was divided among loosely allied regions.

[[Viking Age in Estonia|The Viking Age in Estonia|annotation]] is often considered to be part of the Iron Age period which started around [[400 AD|DATE]] and ended around [[1200 AD|DATE]], soon after [[Estonia|Estonian|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] were recorded in the "[[Eric Bloodaxe|Eric|alias_match_single_candidate]] Chronicle" to have sacked Sigtuna in [[1187|DATE]].

The [[Estonia|Estonian|alias_match_single_candidate]] peasant culture came into existence by the end of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

The landscape of [[Ancient Estonia|Ancient Estonia|alias_match_match_candidate]] featured numerous hillforts, some later hillforts on [[Saaremaa|Saaremaa|annotation]] heavily fortified during the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] and on to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|12th century|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The [[Estonia|Estonian|alias_match_single_candidate]] islands also have a number of graves from the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]], both individual and collective, with weapons and jewellery.

Weapons found in [[Viking Age in Estonia|Estonian Viking Age|alias_match_single_candidate]] graves are common to types found throughout [[Nordic countries|Northern Europe|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]].

Chapter [[46|NUMBER]] of [[Egil's Saga|Egils Saga|annotation]] describes [[one|NUMBER]] [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] expedition by the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] Thorolf and [[Egill Skallagrímsson|Egill Skallagrímsson|annotation]] in [[Courland|LOCATION]].

It was the time of rapid expansion of the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Nordic countries|Northern Europe|alias_match_single_candidate]]; [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] began to pay [[Danegeld|Danegeld|annotation]] in [[859|NUMBER]], and the [[Curonians|Curonians|annotation]] of [[Grobiņa|Grobin|annotation]] faced an invasion by the [[Swedes|Swedes|alias_match_popular_entity]] at about the same date.

In [[862|NUMBER]], the Finnic and Slavic tribes rebelled against the [[Varangians|Varangian Rus|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], driving them overseas back to [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]], but soon started to conflict with each other.

[[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] settlements were set up along the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic Sea|annotation]], primarily for trade purposes.

There is evidence that [[Frisians|Frisians|alias_match_match_candidate]] sometimes became [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] themselves

At the same time, several [[Frisians|Frisian|alias_match_single_candidate]] towns, most notably [[Dorestad|Dorestad|annotation]] were raided by [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]].

On [[Wieringen|Wieringen|annotation]] the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] most likely had a base of operations.

Some [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] leaders took an active role in [[Frisians|Frisian|alias_match_single_candidate]] politics, like [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|annotation]].

The French region of [[Normandy|Normandy|alias_match_match_candidate]] takes its name from the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] invaders who were called "Normanni", which means ‘men of the [[North Germanic languages|North|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]'.

The [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Viking Age|Viking raids|alias_match_article_entity]] began between [[790|NUMBER]] [[and|NUMBER]] [[800|NUMBER]] along the coasts of western [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

They were carried out primarily in the [[summer|DATE]], as the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] wintered in [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]].

But the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] took advantage of the quarrels in the royal family caused after the death of [[Louis the Pious|Louis the Pious|alias_match_match_candidate]] to settle their [[first|ORDINAL]] colony in the south-west ([[Gascony|Gascony|annotation]]) of [[Charlemagne|the king|non_person_coref]]dom of [[Francia|Francia|alias_match_match_candidate]], which was more or less abandoned by the [[Francia|Frankish|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] kings after their [[two|NUMBER]] defeats at Roncevaux.

The [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] attackers sought to capture [[Cuerdale Hoard|the treasure|non_person_coref]]s stored at monasteries, easy prey given the monks' lack of defensive capacity.

In [[911|NUMBER]], a band of [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] warriors attempted to siege [[Chartres|LOCATION]] but was defeated by [[Robert I of France|Robert I of France|annotation]].

In exchange, [[Rollo|Rollo|alias_match_match_candidate]] pledged vassalage to [[Charles II of England|Charles|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] in [[940|NUMBER]], agreed to be baptised, and vowed to guard the estuaries of the [[Seine|Seine|alias_match_match_candidate]] from further [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] attacks.

By the end of the reign of [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard I of Normandy|annotation]] in [[996|NUMBER]] (aka [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard the Fearless|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] / [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] sans Peur), all descendants of [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] became, according to Cambridge [[Middle Ages|Medieval History|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] (Volume [[5|NUMBER]], Chapter XV), 'not only Christians but in all essentials Frenchmen'.

In [[860|NUMBER]], according to an account by the [[Normans|Norman|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] monk [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin|Dudo of Saint-Quentin|annotation]], a [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] fleet, probably under [[Björn Ironside|Björn Ironside|annotation]] and [[Hastein|Hastein|annotation]], landed at the Ligurian port of [[Luni, Italy|Luni|annotation]] and sacked [[Rouen|the city|non_person_coref]].

After [[842|NUMBER]], when the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] set up a permanent base at the mouth of the [[Loire|Loire|annotation]] river, they could strike as far as northern [[Spain|Spain|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

These [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] were Hispanicised in all [[Christians|Christian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] kingdoms, while they kept their ethnic identity and culture in [[Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus|annotation]].

In [[1015|DATE]], a [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] fleet entered [[Loire|the river|non_person_coref]] Minho and sacked the episcopal city of [[Tui, Pontevedra|Tui|annotation]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia|annotation]]); no new bishop was appointed until [[1070|DATE]].

After a siege, the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] conquered [[Lisbon|Lisbon|annotation]] (at the [[time|DATE]], [[Lisbon|the city|non_person_coref]] was under [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule|alias_match_single_candidate]] and known as "Lashbuna").

The [[Viking Age|Viking-Age|alias_match_article_entity]] settlements in [[Greenland|Greenland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] were established in the sheltered fjords of the southern and western coast.

In about [[986|NUMBER]], the [[Norway|Norwegian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Bjarni Herjólfsson|Bjarni Herjólfsson|annotation]], [[Leif Erikson|Leif Ericson|annotation]] and [[Thorfinn Karlsefni|Þórfinnr Karlsefni|annotation]] from [[Greenland|Greenland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] reached [[North America|Mainland North America|annotation]], over [[500 years|DURATION]] before [[Christopher Columbus|Christopher Columbus|annotation]], and they attempted to settle the land they called [[Vinland|Vinland|annotation]].

The effectiveness of these tactics earned [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.

Because of the ships' negligible draft, the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers.

While battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] ships attempted to board [[Western Europe|European|alias_match_single_candidate]] merchant vessels in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] waters.

When larger scale battles ensued, [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets.

The roping technique allowed [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems.

A [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle.

In general, these tactics enabled [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.

Exactly how the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] navigated the open seas with such success is unclear.

While some evidence points to the use of calcite "sunstones" to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] "sky-polarimetric" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.

Recent evidence suggests that the [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] also made use of an optical compass as a navigation aid, using the light-splitting and polarisation-filtering properties of [[Iceland spar|Iceland spar|annotation]] to find [[Vinland|the location|non_person_coref]] of the sun when it was not directly visible.

Some of the most important trading ports founded by the [[Viking Age|Norse|alias_match_article_entity]] during the period include both existing and former cities such as [[Aarhus|Aarhus|annotation]] ([[Denmark|Denmark|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Ribe|Ribe|annotation]] ([[Denmark|Denmark|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Hedeby|Hedeby|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Germany|Germany|LOCATION_popular_entity]]), [[Vineta|Vineta|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Pomerania|Pomerania|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Truso|Truso|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Poland|Poland|LOCATION_popular_entity]]), [[Bergen|Bjørgvin|annotation]] ([[Norway|Norway|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Kaupang|Kaupang|annotation]] ([[Norway|Norway|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Skiringssal|Skiringssal|annotation]] ([[Norway|Norway|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Birka|Birka|annotation]] ([[Sweden|Sweden|alias_match_match_candidate]]), [[Bordeaux|Bordeaux|annotation]] ([[France|France|alias_match_popular_entity]]), [[Scandinavian York|York|annotation]] ([[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]]), [[Dublin|Dublin|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]]) and [[Staraya Ladoga|Aldeigjuborg|annotation]] ([[Russia|Russia|alias_match_popular_entity]]).

A genetic study published at bioRxiv in [[July 2019|DATE]] and in "Nature" in [[September 2020|DATE]] examined the population genomics of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

In terms of Y-DNA composition, [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] individuals were similar to present-day [[Scandinavia|Scandinavians|alias_match_single_line_candidate]].

It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[the years|DURATION]] preceding the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] and during the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] itself.

The Y-DNA of [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]] samples suggests that [[this may|DATE]] partly have been descendants of the Germanic tribes from the [[Migration Period|Migration Period|alias_match_match_candidate]] returning to [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]].

The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

Unsurprisingly, and very much consistent with historical records, the study found evidence of a major influx of [[Vikings|Danish Viking|alias_match_single_candidate]] ancestry into [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]], a [[Sweden|Swedish|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] influx into [[Estonia|Estonia|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Finland|Finland|LOCATION_popular_entity]]; and [[Norway|Norwegian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] influx into [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Iceland|Iceland|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Greenland|Greenland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] during the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Vikings|The Vikings|alias_match_single_candidate]] were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in [[Ayrshire|the area|non_person_coref]]s they settled, which has persisted into modern times with e.g. the contemporary population of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom|alias_match_popular_entity]] having up to [[6%|PERCENT]] [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] DNA.

The study also showed that some local people of [[Scotland|Scotland|alias_match_match_candidate]] were buried as [[Viking Age|Vikings|alias_match_article_entity]] and may have taken on [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] identities.

During, and as a result of the [[Viking Age|Viking Age|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Viking Age|Scandinavia|alias_match_article_entity]] moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the [[three|NUMBER]] [[Nordic countries|Nordic countries|alias_match_match_candidate]] that still exist [[today|DATE]].

The long-term linguistic effect of the [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] settlements in [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] was threefold: over a [[thousand|NUMBER]] [[Old Norse|Old Norse|alias_match_match_candidate]] words eventually became part of [[Standard English|Standard English|annotation]]; numerous places in the [[Byzantine Empire|East|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and [[North America|North-|alias_match_single_candidate]]east of [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]] have [[Denmark|Danish|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] names, and many [[Standard English|English|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] personal names are of [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] origin.

The distribution of family names showing [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] influence is still, as an analysis of names ending in "-son" reveals, concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former [[Viking Age|Viking|alias_match_article_entity]] settlement.

[[Perth House|Perth House|alias_match_article_entity]] and Stables has a considerable degree of unity in its materials, form and scale and is a rare reminder of the harmonious and generally low scale architectural character [[once|DATE]] in [[Parramatta|Parramatta|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Perth House|Perth House|alias_match_article_entity]] and Stables is an important and typical example of a [[1850|DATE]] house designed by the fashionable [[Parramatta|Parramatta|alias_match_match_candidate]] architect of [[the day|DATE]], [[James Houison|PERSON]].

Tránsito Amaguaña

[[Tránsito Amaguaña|Rosa Elena Tránsito Amaguaña Alba|annotation]] ([[September 10, 1909|DATE]] – [[May 10, 2009|DATE]]) was an Ecuadorian leader of the indigenous movement and [[one|NUMBER]] of the founders of the Ecuadorian Indian Federation (FEI) along with [[Dolores Cacuango|Dolores Cacuango|annotation]].

Born into a family of slaves and ‘property’ of the landowner , [[Tránsito Amaguaña|Tránsito Amaguaña|alias_match_article_entity]] helped [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] parents on their small piece of land.

As it was common for girls to be raped by the landowners, [[Tránsito Amaguaña|Tránsito|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]’s mother decided [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] daughter would be better marrying an older man.

[[Tránsito Amaguaña|She|PERSON_coref]] was married at the age of [[15|NUMBER]] to a [[25-year-old|DURATION]] and became pregnant almost immediately.

Tránsito’s husband was cruel and beat [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] repeatedly.

The young Tránsito became involved in the [[Socialist Party|ORGANIZATION]] and on discovering this [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] husband beat [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] so violently that [[Lucio Gutiérrez|he|PERSON_coref]] tired himself out, [[the next morning|DATE]] [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] discovered [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] baby dead in [[Lucio Gutiérrez|his|PERSON_coref]] cot.

By the time [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] was able to free herself from [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] violent husband [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] had [[two|NUMBER]] more children by [[Lucio Gutiérrez|him|PERSON_coref]].

On [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] own, [[Tránsito Amaguaña|Tránsito|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] continued to work the land in exchange for food for herself and [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] children.

In [[1930|DATE]] [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] helped to set up the [[first|ORDINAL]] indigenous organization of [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] country and took part in [[26|NUMBER]] marches to the capital, [[Quito|Quito|LOCATION_popular_entity]], to demand justice for [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] people.

[[Quito|Quito|LOCATION_popular_entity]] was [[66|NUMBER]] kilometers from [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] home and [[Tránsito Amaguaña|Tránsito|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] did this carrying [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] [[two|NUMBER]] children.

[[Tránsito Amaguaña|She|PERSON_coref]] helped organize and took part in the [[first|ORDINAL]] worker’s union.

Tránsito had to live [[the|DURATION]] [[next 15 months|DATE]] of [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] life in hiding from the authorities.

Among [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] people [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] was greatly admired, but the authorities constantly threatened [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]].

[[Tránsito Amaguaña|She|PERSON_coref]] later joined the [[Communist Party|ORGANIZATION]] and traveled to [[Cuba|Cuba|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|LOCATION_popular_entity]] to represent the Ecuadorian people.

Tránsito was arrested on return from [[one|NUMBER]] of these tours and detained, accused of trafficking weapons and Bolshevik money to incite revolution, all [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] had was documentation for promoting land reforms.

[[Tránsito Amaguaña|She|PERSON_coref]] was released after [[4 months|DURATION]] after being made to sign a declaration that [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] would not continue ‘agitating’ [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] people.

But of course [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] did not stop, in true style of the revolutionary woman that [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] was, [[Tránsito Amaguaña|she|PERSON_coref]] continued [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] work, fighting for equality and justice for [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] people.

Tránsito retired on a state pension and died of unknown causes in [[Tránsito Amaguaña|her|PERSON_coref]] home village of Pesillo in [[2009|DATE]].

[[Tránsito Amaguaña|Her|PERSON_coref]] funeral was attended by President [[Rafael Correa|Rafael Correa|annotation]] and vice president [[Lenín Moreno|Lenín Moreno|annotation]] and various indigenous leaders.

U.S. Route 59 in Kansas

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|U.S. Route 59|annotation]] ([[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|annotation]]) is a part of the [[United States Numbered Highway System|U.S. Highway System|annotation]] that runs from the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexico–US border|annotation]] in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo, Texas|annotation]], as a continuation of [[Mexican Federal Highway 85D|Mexican Federal Highway 85D|annotation]] north to the [[Lancaster–Tolstoi Border Crossing|Lancaster–Tolstoi Border Crossing|annotation]] on the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border|annotation]], where it continues as [[Manitoba|Manitoba|LOCATION_popular_entity]] [[United States Numbered Highway System|Highway|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[59|NUMBER]].

In the [[U.S. state|U.S. state|annotation]] of [[Kansas|Kansas|annotation]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] is a main north - south highway that travels from [[Chetopa|Chetopa|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]] to [[Atchison|LOCATION]].

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] is a [[210|NUMBER]] mi highway which runs from south to north in eastern [[Kansas|Kansas|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Almost the entire length of [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Kansas|Kansas|alias_match_match_candidate]] is maintained by the [[Kansas|Kansas|alias_match_match_candidate]] Department of Transportation (KDOT).

The [[2.613|NUMBER]] mi section of [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] within [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison|alias_match_single_candidate]] is maintained by [[Atchison, Kansas|the city|non_person_coref]].

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] enters [[Kansas|Kansas|alias_match_match_candidate]] south of [[Chetopa, Kansas|Chetopa|alias_match_single_candidate]] along a two-lane highway.

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] turns west along [[Maple|PERSON]] and the [[two|NUMBER]] routes run together for [[1.5|NUMBER]] mi.

After curving to the north and reaching the northern city limits, [[U.S. Route 166|US 166|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] splits off to the west and [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] continues north.

Just before reaching [[Altamont, Kansas|Altamont|annotation]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] splits off to the north leaving [[U.S. Route 160|US-160|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to continue west.

After its intersection with [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-54, [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] continues north toward [[Mildred, Kansas|Mildred|annotation]].

In and around [[Mildred, Kansas|Mildred|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|the highway|non_person_coref]] curves to [[once|DATE]] again parallel the [[Union Pacific Railroad|UP|alias_match_single_candidate]] railroad.

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|the highway|non_person_coref]]s continue west then bend to the north to bypass [[Lone Elm, Kansas|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Lone Elm, Kansas|Lone Elm|annotation]].

[[U.S. Route 169|US-169|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] has a business route that begins at this roundabout and follows [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[K-31 (Kansas highway)|K-31|alias_match_single_candidate]] north until [[6th|ORDINAL]] Street.

[[U.S. Route 169|US-169|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] splits off to the east, while [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[K-31 (Kansas highway)|K-31|alias_match_single_candidate]] continue north.

The concurrency with [[K-31 (Kansas highway)|K-31|alias_match_single_candidate]] ends in northern [[Garnett, Kansas|Garnett|alias_match_single_candidate]], as [[K-31 (Kansas highway)|K-31|alias_match_single_candidate]] forks to the west at Park Street and [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] continues north and leaves [[Garnett, Kansas|the city|non_person_coref]].

North of [[Garnett, Kansas|Garnett|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] bypasses a few small lakes by curving slightly to the west, then continues north and enters [[Franklin County, Kansas|Franklin County|annotation]].

Immediately north of [[Franklin County, Kansas|the county|non_person_coref]] line is the small community of [[Richmond, Kansas|Richmond|annotation]], which [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] runs through the western portion of.

A few miles north of here, a couple of curves take [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|the highway|non_person_coref]] northwest, and it heads north to [[Princeton, Kansas|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Princeton, Kansas|Princeton|annotation]].

At this interchange, [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] becomes concurrent with the [[two|NUMBER]] routes and becomes a freeway.

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|the highway|non_person_coref]]s run east momentarily, then curve to the north and intersect [[K-68 (Kansas highway)|K-68|annotation]] and a business route of [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50|alias_match_single_candidate]].

North of this interchange, the routes curve to the east, and [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] leaves [[Interstate 35 in Kansas|I-35|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50|alias_match_single_candidate]] at a trumpet interchange.

After leaving [[Interstate 35 in Kansas|I-35|alias_match_single_candidate]]/[[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] heads north as a controlled-access freeway.

[[Previously|DATE]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] had run through [[Ottawa|Ottawa|alias_match_popular_entity]] to [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]] as a two-lane road.

Due to high accident rates, this stretch of [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] was converted into a divided highway, with the project reaching completion in [[2012|DATE]].

The [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] freeway passes through rural [[Franklin County, Kansas|Franklin County|alias_match_single_candidate]] and crosses into [[Douglas County|Douglas County|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]].

South of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Douglas County|Douglas County|ORGANIZATION_geo_disambiguation]] highway [[458|NUMBER]] becomes concurrent with [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] for a two-mile stretch.

After CR-458 leaves [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] at an at-grade intersection, [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] reaches the south side of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|annotation]] and crosses K-10, known as the South [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]] Trafficway, which heads west as a Super-2 toward [[Clinton Lake|PERSON]], the [[Kansas Turnpike|Kansas Turnpike|annotation]], and [[Lecompton|LOCATION]]; and east as a divided freeway toward [[Olathe|LOCATION]] and [[Lenexa|LOCATION]].

Prior to [[November 2016|DATE]], K-10 was merged with [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] between the South [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]] Trafficway and [[23rd|ORDINAL]] Street due to lawsuits over the completion of the road.

In [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] runs along [[Iowa|Iowa|LOCATION_popular_entity]] Street, home to many retail shopping centers and fast-food restaurants.

North of [[23rd|ORDINAL]] [[Street/Clinton Parkway|LOCATION]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] runs along the western edge of the [[University of Kansas|University of Kansas|annotation]].

After crossing [[9th|ORDINAL]] Street, travelers seeking access to the [[Kansas Turnpike|Kansas Turnpike|alias_match_match_candidate]] can exit [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] onto [[MacDonald Drive|ORGANIZATION]], while [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] becomes concurrent with [[U.S. Route 40|US-40|annotation]] at [[6th|ORDINAL]] Street.

[[U.S. Route 40|US-40|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]/[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] runs east along [[6th|ORDINAL]] Street until approaching Downtown [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]].

At this point, [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|the highway|non_person_coref]] turns north and crosses the [[Kansas River|Kansas River|annotation]] into the district of North [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]], where [[U.S. Route 40|the road|non_person_coref]] forms parts of [[North 2nd Street and North 3rd Street|ORGANIZATION]].

[[U.S. Route 40|US-40|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]/[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] has an interchange with the [[Kansas Turnpike|Kansas Turnpike|alias_match_match_candidate]], signed as Interstate [[70|NUMBER]], at [[Kansas Turnpike|the turnpike|non_person_coref]]'s East [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]] plaza.

After this, [[U.S. Route 40|US-40|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]/[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] exits the [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]] city limits.

After leaving [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[U.S. Route 40|US-40|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]/[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] meets [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-24 at an intersection known locally as "Teepee Junction".

[[U.S. Route 40|US-40|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] joins with [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-24 EB en route to [[Tonganoxie|LOCATION]], while [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] joins with [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-24 [[WB|ORGANIZATION]] en route to [[Oskaloosa, Kansas|Oskaloosa|LOCATION_single_candidate]] and [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

[[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-24/[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] runs northwest parallel to the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific Railroad|annotation]] as it crosses the Douglas/Jefferson county line.

At this point, the [[two|NUMBER]] highways split off, with [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-24 continuing west toward [[Perry|PERSON]] and [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], while [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] heads north toward [[Oskaloosa, Kansas|Oskaloosa|annotation]].

From [[Williamstown, Kansas|Williamstown|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] continues north as a [[two|NUMBER]] lane highway.

This stretch of [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] is part of "The Iron Men Of [[Metz|Metz|PERSON_popular_entity]] [[United States Numbered Highway System|Highway|alias_match_single_candidate]]", a designation running from [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] to [[Leavenworth|LOCATION]] and including the segment of [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] between [[Williamstown, Kansas|Williamstown|alias_match_single_candidate]] and its junction with [[K-16 (Kansas highway)|K-16|annotation]]/[[K-92 (Kansas highway)|K-92|annotation]] just outside of [[Oskaloosa, Kansas|Oskaloosa|alias_match_single_candidate]].

At this junction, [[K-16 (Kansas highway)|K-16|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[K-92 (Kansas highway)|K-92|alias_match_single_candidate]] both become concurrent with [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]]/[[K-16 (Kansas highway)|K-16|alias_match_single_candidate]] continues north until it meets a junction with [[K-192 (Kansas highway)|K-192|annotation]] west of [[Winchester, Kansas|Winchester|annotation]], at which point [[K-16 (Kansas highway)|K-16|alias_match_single_candidate]] leaves [[U.S. Route 40|the road|non_person_coref]] and heads west toward [[Valley Falls, Kansas|Valley Falls|annotation]].

From here [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] continues north until reaching [[Nortonville, Kansas|Nortonville|annotation]].

After this, [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] crosses into [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison|alias_match_single_candidate]] County and takes a more northeasterly route as it crosses [[Franklin County, Kansas|the county|non_person_coref]].

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] enters [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison|annotation]] and becomes part of a wrong-way concurrency with [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-73 as it runs through the western portion of town.

This concurrency ends at a junction with K-7, as [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-73 leaves [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] to become concurrent with K-7 and run south to [[Leavenworth|LOCATION]].

[[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59|alias_match_article_entity]] continues east on its own through the rest of town and crosses the [[Amelia Earhardt Memorial Bridge|ORGANIZATION]] into [[Winthrop|LOCATION]], [[Missouri|Missouri|alias_match_popular_entity]], en route to [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph|annotation]].

[[G. "Anand" Anandalingam|G. "Anand" Anandalingam|annotation]] is [[currently|DATE]] [[Ralph J. Tyser|PERSON]] Professor of [[Management Science|ORGANIZATION]] at [[the University of Maryland|ORGANIZATION]].

Before joining the [[Robert H. Smith School of Business|Smith School|annotation]] in [[2001|DATE]], [[G. "Anand" Anandalingam|Anandalingam|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was a faculty member at the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania|annotation]] for [[nearly 15 years|DURATION]].

[[Robert H.

History of Wetherby

In [[1240|DATE]] the [[Knights Templar|Knights Templar|alias_match_match_candidate]] were granted by Royal Charter of [[Henry III of England|Henry III|annotation]] the right to hold a market in [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] (known then as Werreby).

According to the blue plaque  at the entrance to [[Scott Lane|PERSON]], it could be named after the Scottish raiders in [[1318|DATE]], or perhaps after [[the 18th century|DATE]] drovers who used [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] as a watering place.

For [[15 years|DURATION]] [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was home to a castle built without the consent of the [[Henry III of England|King|alias_match_single_candidate]] or Parliament.

Before marching to [[Tadcaster|Tadcaster|annotation]] and on to [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor|annotation]], the Parliamentarians spent [[two days|DURATION]] in [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] while joining forces with the Scots.

To fund work on [[Oliver Cromwell|his|PERSON_coref]] house at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth|annotation]], the [[Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire|annotation]] sold the Manor of [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], with the exception of [[one|NUMBER]] house.

The sale catalogue for the sale of the "Whole of the large market town of Wetherby (with the exception of [[one|NUMBER]] house therein)" describes [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] as an important stop on the high turnpike from [[Ferrybridge|Ferry Bridge|annotation]] to [[Glasgow|Glasgow|annotation]].

In Victorian times, [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was a rural town, the major town for the surrounding rural districts where the cattle market was located, [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] industrialised during this era, though less than in the more textile dependent areas of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding|annotation]].

Although [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s Victorian industrial development was neither notable nor significant, the industrial revolution did not bypass it, and [[Tadcaster|the town|non_person_coref]] experienced growth.

By [[the 1860s|DATE]], the [[Wetherby News|ORGANIZATION]] campaigned to link [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] to [[Leeds|Leeds|annotation]] by railway.

In [[1866|DATE]] the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|NER|annotation]] began construction of the [[Cross Gates|ORGANIZATION]] to [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] line, the link to [[Leeds|Leeds|alias_match_match_candidate]].

From the building of the Cross Gates-Wetherby line until its closure, raceday specials ran from [[Bradford Interchange|Bradford Interchange|annotation]] to [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

By around [[the start of the 20th century|DATE]], [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had a mixed economy.

The trades which had kept [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] going in [[earlier decades|DURATION]] still thrived, such as the cattle market and [[Harrogate|the town|non_person_coref]]s many inns, which served travellers on the A1.

The growth of the railways in [[the 19th century|DATE]] had lessened [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s strategic position on the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|Great North Road|annotation]].

Like many other towns in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding|annotation]], [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] suffered heavy losses in the [[World War I|First World War|annotation]], with many [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] men attached to the [[Leeds Pals|Leeds Pals|annotation]], who suffered particularly heavy losses at the [[Battle of the Somme|Battle of the Somme|annotation]].

A memorial to the losses suffered by [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] in the [[World War I|Great War|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], designed by [[E.F. Roslyn|PERSON]] was erected adjacent to [[Harrogate|the town|non_person_coref]]s bridge in [[1922|DATE]].

Unusually, [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] does not have a memorial to its losses in the [[World War II|Second World War|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[one|NUMBER]] was neither erected or as in many towns, a list of the dead added to the [[World War I|Great War|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] memorial.

Both the LNER [[Cross Gates|Cross Gates|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] line and the [[Harrogate|LOCATION]] to [[Church Fenton|ORGANIZATION]] line closed in [[1965|DATE]] under the [[Beeching cuts|Beeching Axe|annotation]].

The upgrade of the section between [[Bramham|PERSON]] and [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] started in [[July 2007|DATE]] and was scheduled to be completed in [[2009|DATE]].

This will include another large hotel, the only [[one|NUMBER]] in [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], North of the [[River Wharfe|River Wharfe|annotation]].

Although [[the 20th century|DATE]] saw the loss of [[History of Wetherby|Wetherby|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s mill and brewery, it also saw the development of the [[Sandbeck Industrial Estate|ORGANIZATION]] and the nearby [[Thorp Arch Trading Estate|Thorp Arch Trading Estate|annotation]].





William Ronald

[[William Ronald|William Ronald Smith|annotation]] ([[August 13, 1926|DATE]] - [[February 9, 1998|DATE]]), known professionally as [[William Ronald|William Ronald|annotation]], was an important Canadian painter, best known as the founder of the influential Canadian abstract art group [[Painters Eleven|Painters Eleven|annotation]] in [[1954|DATE]] and for [[William Ronald|his|PERSON_coref]] "central image" paintings.

[[William Ronald|He|PERSON_coref]] was the older brother of painter [[John Meredith (artist)|John Meredith|annotation]] ([[1933|DATE]] [[-|DURATION]] [[2000|DATE]]).

[[William Ronald|William Ronald|alias_match_article_entity]] was a graduate of the [[OCAD University|Ontario College of Art|annotation]] in [[1951|DATE]] who quickly found that abstract painters could not get their work exhibited in [[Toronto|Toronto|annotation]] galleries.

Since [[William Ronald|he|PERSON_coref]] had [[previously|DATE]] Worked for the "[[Robert Simpson Co.|ORGANIZATION]]" department store, [[William Ronald|he|PERSON_coref]] persuaded management to pair abstract paintings with furniture displays, thereby discovering a way to get the public to accept non-representational art.

Despite the success of that show, "Abstracts at Home", [[William Ronald|Ronald|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] resented [[Toronto|the city|non_person_coref]]'s general attitude toward its artists and moved to the [[United States|United States|annotation]], eventually becoming an [[United States|American|alias_match_single_candidate]] citizen.

Eventually, [[William Ronald|Ronald|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] returned to [[Toronto|Toronto|alias_match_match_candidate]], as a landed immigrant in [[United States|the country|non_person_coref]] of [[William Ronald|his|PERSON_coref]] birth, partly due to changing market conditions and partly because [[William Ronald|he|PERSON_coref]] could not get along with [[Samuel M. Kootz|Kootz|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

Never a stranger to criticism or polemics, [[William Ronald|Ronald|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] loved to paint in public, frequently hiring strippers and showgirls to dance around [[William Ronald|him|PERSON_coref]] as [[William Ronald|he|PERSON_coref]] painted.

[[William Ronald|He|PERSON_coref]] continued to paint until [[William Ronald|his|PERSON_coref]] death in [[1998|DATE]] and in fact suffered a heart attack while painting "Untitled".

[[William Ronald|He|PERSON_coref]] succumbed [[a few days later|DATE]].





SmartPOST

[[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|annotation]] is an [[Estonia|Estonia|annotation]]n logistics company which specializes in delivery of goods and self-servicing post offices.

Founded in [[2008|DATE]], [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] [[currently|DATE]] operates [[46|NUMBER]] self-servicing post offices over [[Estonia|Estonia|alias_match_match_candidate]] through a solution called "[[Delivery Point Solution|Delivery Point Solution|acronym_entity]]" ([[Delivery Point Solution|DPS|acronym]]).

[[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]]'s solution was implemented in [[April 2009|DATE]].

Unlike other similar systems (such as the [[Packstation|Packstation|annotation]] solution in [[Germany|Germany|LOCATION_popular_entity]]), [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] has placed its Delivery Point Solution indoors (e.g. in shopping malls), making them convenient to use even with bad weather.

In [[July 2009|DATE]], [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] reported it was in negotiations with an Italian company interested in licensing [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]]'s Delivery Point Solution for usage in [[Italy|Italy|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Currently|DATE]] [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] is servicing roughly [[two hundred|NUMBER]] distant selling companies and online shops in [[Estonia|Estonia|alias_match_match_candidate]].

During its [[first year|DATE]] of operation, [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] reported a [[13.8 million|NUMBER]] [[Estonian kroon|EEK|annotation]] (about [[1.2 million|NUMBER]] [[United States dollar|USD|annotation]]) turnover with an [[8.3 million|NUMBER]] ([[$740,000|MONEY]] [[United States dollar|USD|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) profit loss.

[[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]]'s member of board [[Antti Oolup|PERSON]] said that the loss was expected and planned, with monthly profits planned for [[the end of 2009|DATE]].

[[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] reported that over [[33 thousand|NUMBER]] packages were sent through its service in [[Estonia|Estonia|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[December 2009|DATE]].

[[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] was chosen as the Logistics Deed [[2009|DATE]] at the annual Purchase Management and [[Logistics Conference|ORGANIZATION]].

At [[the end of 2009|DATE]], [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] also reported that it will expand its business to [[Finland|Finland|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[November 2010|DATE]], [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]]'s CEO position was taken over from [[Indrek Oolup|PERSON]] by [[Risto Eelmaa|PERSON]].

In [[October 2009|DATE]], [[Estonia|Estonia|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s national postal company [[Estonia|Eesti|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Post filed a complaint with the [[Estonia|Estonian|alias_match_single_candidate]] Consumer Union, claiming that [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]]'s television advertisements were damaging the reputation of [[Estonia|Eesti|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Post and also "calling viewers up to violence against elderly people".

[[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] responded that the claim was untrue and damaging reputation or calls for violence were not their intention.

In [[July 2010|DATE]], the [[Estonia|Estonian|alias_match_single_candidate]] Development Fund (majority shareholder in [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]]) sold its share to the Finnish postal service and logistics company [[Posti Group|Itella|annotation]].

[[Raivo Vare|PERSON]], Head of the [[Estonia|Estonian|alias_match_single_candidate]] Development Fund commented on the sale, saying: "Risk investment is a field where there are few success stories, but [[SmartPOST|SmartPOST|alias_match_article_entity]] is definitely [[one|NUMBER]] of them.

Drama of Exile

By [[March 1978|DATE]], after "The Sphinx" was also introduced into [[Nico|her|PERSON_coref]] set, [[Nico|Nico|alias_match_match_candidate]] titled [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] "[[Drama of Exile|Drama of Exile|alias_match_article_entity]]" and attempted a new style at odds with [[Nico|her|PERSON_coref]] previous harmonium-based sound.

[[Nico|Nico|alias_match_match_candidate]] continued to write and had enough songs ready to record [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] in [[1981|DATE]].

With [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] nearly finished and following a disagreement over money, [[Aaron Sixx|PERSON]], the head of Aura at the [[time|DATE]], allegedly received a tip-off from the studio that Nadette Duget ([[Nico|Nico|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s unofficial manager) had arranged to steal the master tapes from the studio and sell them without reimbursing Aura, but since [[Sixx|PERSON]] had a signed contract with [[Duget|PERSON]] and [[Quilichini|PERSON]], [[Sixx|PERSON]] was able to take possession of all the multitrack, unmixed tapes.

[[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] cover was a large, black "N" with a white background and a nod to Corsican French emperor [[Napoleon|Napoleon|PERSON_popular_entity]] who ended [[Napoleon|his|PERSON_coref]] life in exile.

False stories of the Aura label having released the only official album with [[Nico|Nico|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s consent and of Quilichini having secretly copied the [[first|ORDINAL]] version of [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] tapes to remix later emerged:

"In [[1983|DATE]], having won the legal battle, Aura proceeded to release [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]].

tapes and had an illegal version of [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] released in [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]]. Aura quickly puts a stop to this album and it was subsequently withdrawn.""

[[Aaron Sixx|PERSON]] managed to rescue them with a [[last minute|DATE]] dash to the studios, but with their plan thwarted the couple severely delayed the release of [[Drama of Exile|the album|non_person_coref]] by trying to take [[Aaron Sixx|him|PERSON_coref]] to court.

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] civil war, over the attempted secession by [[Biafra|Biafra|annotation]] from [[Nigeria|Nigeria|LOCATION_popular_entity]], was the location for "[[Solo (Boyd novel)|Solo|alias_match_article_entity]]", although [[William Boyd (writer)|Boyd|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] renamed this as the fictional Zanzarim.

Much of the criticism about [[Devil May Care (Faulks novel)|the novel|non_person_coref]] focuses on the plot; [[Jon Stock|Jon Stock|annotation]], writing in "[[The Daily Telegraph|The Daily Telegraph|annotation]]", thought that although [[William Boyd (writer)|Boyd|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] used details in the same way [[Ian Fleming|Fleming|alias_match_single_candidate]] did that would appeal to [[James Bond|Bond|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] aficionados, [[Solo (Boyd novel)|the book|non_person_coref]] was based on "a curiously unstirring plot", which was also "convoluted".

Diamond Bessie

[[Diamond Bessie|Diamond Bessie|annotation]] ([[1854|DATE]] - [[December 31, 1877|DATE]]) was the popular name given to [[Bessie Moore|PERSON]], née [[Annie Stone|PERSON]], a prostitute whose murder in the woods outside [[Jefferson, Texas|Jefferson|annotation]], [[Texas|Texas|annotation]], propelled [[Bessie Moore|her|PERSON_coref]] to the level of local legend.

[[Bessie Moore|She|PERSON_coref]] was killed by a single gunshot wound to the head, allegedly by [[Bessie Moore|her|PERSON_coref]] husband, [[Diamond Bessie|Abraham Rothschild|alias_match_article_entity]] (no relation to the banking family).

The abundance of attention from men resulting from [[Diamond Bessie|her|PERSON_coref]] striking beauty is said to have led [[Diamond Bessie|her|PERSON_coref]] down the proverbial "wayward path" at a young age.

At [[15|NUMBER]], [[Diamond Bessie|she|PERSON_coref]] left home and took up with a man named [[Moore|PERSON]].

[[Diamond Bessie|She|PERSON_coref]] was described as an extraordinary beauty with black hair and brilliant grey eyes.

After this affair ended, [[Diamond Bessie|she|PERSON_coref]] entered into prostitution (though [[Diamond Bessie|she|PERSON_coref]] kept [[Moore|PERSON]]'s name).

By all accounts, [[Diamond Bessie|she|PERSON_coref]] adapted to the life quickly, and [[Diamond Bessie|her|PERSON_coref]] numerous male admirers showered [[Diamond Bessie|her|PERSON_coref]] with gifts of diamond jewelry.

A story that [[Diamond Bessie|she|PERSON_coref]] had a large inheritance from [[Diamond Bessie|her|PERSON_coref]] father may be apocryphal.

Bessie plied [[Diamond Bessie|her|PERSON_coref]] trade in brothels, firstly in the [[Mansion of Joy brothel|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio|annotation]].

[[Diamond Bessie|She|PERSON_coref]] later worked at brothels in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana|annotation]] and finally [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs, Arkansas|annotation]].

Whatever the motive, [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s relationship was known to be tumultuous, marred by alcoholism and physical abuse.

[[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild|alias_match_single_candidate]] is said to have forced [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] to prostitute herself numerous times during their travels together, and to give [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|him|PERSON_coref]] [[$50.00|MONEY]] [[a day|DURATION]].

[[Diamond Bessie|She|PERSON_coref]] may have been suffering from a venereal disease.

Their fine clothes and, of course, [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s diamonds, made an immediate impression on the townsfolk.

[[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild|alias_match_single_candidate]] is said to have [[first|ORDINAL]] addressed [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|his|PERSON_coref]] "wife" as [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] during this trip, and the locals adapted this into "[[Diamond Bessie|Diamond Bessie|alias_match_article_entity]]".

The last person to see them together was [[Frank Malloy|PERSON]], who noticed them in the restaurant before [[11:00 am|TIME]]; [[Malloy|PERSON]] took special note of [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s massive diamond rings.

When questioned about [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|his|PERSON_coref]] wife's whereabouts at the [[Brooks House|ORGANIZATION]], [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild|alias_match_single_candidate]] claimed [[Diamond Bessie|she|PERSON_coref]] had stayed across the [[Bayou|LOCATION]] to visit friends.

[[The following morning|DATE]], [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|he|PERSON_coref]] took breakfast alone at the hotel, where [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|he|PERSON_coref]] was seen wearing [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s rings.

On [[the morning of|TIME]] [[Tuesday|DATE]][[,|TIME]] [[January 23|DATE]], [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|he|PERSON_coref]] boarded a train to [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati|alias_match_match_candidate]] with [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|his|PERSON_coref]] and [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s luggage.

The townsfolk held a collection and raised [[$150|MONEY]] to pay for [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s burial.

After [[a few days|DURATION]] in the hospital, [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|he|PERSON_coref]] was arrested and jailed, awaiting extradition to [[Texas|Texas|alias_match_match_candidate]] for the murder of "[[Diamond Bessie|Diamond Bessie|alias_match_article_entity]] Moore".

There was widespread opinion that [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Rothschild|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s wealth and [[Diamond Bessie|Bessie|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] being a prostitute influenced the appellate court.

[[Diamond Bessie|Diamond Bessie|alias_match_article_entity]] became a figure of folklore.

A Serbian Film

"A Serbian Film" (Српски филм / "[[A Serbian Film|Srpski film|alias_match_article_entity]]") is a [[2010|DATE]] Serbian exploitation film produced and directed by [[Srđan Spasojević|PERSON]] in [[Srđan Spasojević|his|PERSON_coref]] feature film debut.

The [[first|ORDINAL]] ever showing of "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" took place on [[15|TIME]] [[March 2010|DATE]] [[at midnight|TIME]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin|annotation]] as part of the [[2010|DATE]] [[South by Southwest|South by Southwest|annotation]].

[[Tim League|He|PERSON_coref]] also coaxed a handful of audience members to join [[Tim League|him|PERSON_coref]] on the stage – where they jointly snorted lines of salt, squeezed lime juice into their eyes and took shots of tequila in order to "understand what Serbians have been through to create a culture of "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]"".

"[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" thus became the most censored cinema release in [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] since the [[1994|DATE]] Indian film "[[Nammavar|Nammavar|annotation]]" that had [[five minutes|DURATION]] and [[eight seconds|DURATION]] of its violent content removed.

[[Now|DATE]] that those charges have been dropped, we can bring "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" to its fans as its director had intended."

"[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" was banned by a court in [[San Sebastián|San Sebastián|annotation]], [[Spain|Spain|annotation]] for "threatening sexual freedom" and thus could not be shown in the [[XXI Semana|LOCATION]] de Cine Fantástico y de Terror ([[21st|ORDINAL]] Horror and Fantasy Film Festival).

According to the [[Review Board|ORGANIZATION]], ""[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" could not be accommodated within the R18+ classification as the level of depictions of sexual violence, themes of incest, and depictions of child sexual abuse in [[Buried (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] has an impact which is very high and not justified by context."

While acknowledging some level of conservatism among the public and theater owners, [[Spasojević|PERSON]] says that government-enforced censorship in [[Serbia|Serbia|alias_match_popular_entity]] is non-existent and was not the driving force behind the making of "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]": "In [[Serbia|Serbia|alias_match_popular_entity]] we don't have ratings, there is no law forbidding anything from being shown in a film and there is no law forbidding anyone from buying a ticket."

I have a problem with "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]".

I've got a serious problem with the boy whose father got wealthy during [[the '90s|DATE]] – nothing against making money, but I know how money was made [in [[Serbia|Serbia|alias_match_popular_entity]]] during [[the '90s|DATE]] – and then pays for [[Zoran Janković|his|PERSON_coref]] son's education abroad and eventually the kid comes back to [[Serbia|Serbia|alias_match_popular_entity]] to film [[Zoran Janković|his|PERSON_coref]] view of [[Serbia|the country|non_person_coref]] using [[Zoran Janković|his|PERSON_coref]] dad's money and even calls the whole thing "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]".

Based on [[32|NUMBER]] reviews collected by [[Buried (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes|Rotten Tomatoes|annotation]], [[47%|PERCENT]] of critics gave "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" a positive review, with an average rating of [[5.24|NUMBER]]/[[10|NUMBER]].

As is often the case with movies like this, "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" revels in its sheer inventive awfulness and dares the viewer to find a more serious layer of meaning."

There are those who will be unable (or unwilling) to decipher even the most basic of 'messages' buried within "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]", but I believe it's [[one

"[[Time Out Group|Time Out New York|annotation]]"s [[Joshua Rothkopf|PERSON]] accuses "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" of pandering to "mouth-breathing gorehounds who found "[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel|alias_match_single_candidate]]" a bit too soft (i.e., fanatics who would hijack the horror genre into extremity because deeper thinking is too hard)" before concluding that "the movie says as much about [[Eastern Europe|Eastern Europe|annotation]] as "[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight|annotation]]" does about the [[Pacific Northwest|Pacific Northwest|annotation]]".

In [[Tim Anderson|his|PERSON_coref]] very negative review of "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]", [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC Radio 5 Live|annotation]]'s [[Mark Kermode|Mark Kermode|annotation]] called it a "nasty piece of exploitation trash in the mould of [[Jörg Buttgereit|Jörg Buttgereit|annotation]] and [[Ruggero Deodato|Ruggero Deodato|annotation]]", going on to add that "if it is somehow an allegory of [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian|alias_match_single_candidate]] family and [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian|alias_match_single_candidate]] politics then the allegory gets lost amidst the increasingly stupid splatter".

Furthermore, [[Ruggero Deodato|he|PERSON_coref]] mentioned "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" again in [[Ruggero Deodato|his|PERSON_coref]] review of "[[Fred: The Movie|Fred: The Movie|annotation]]", pairing the [[two|NUMBER]] as [[Ruggero Deodato|his|PERSON_coref]] least favourite viewing experiences of [[the year|DATE]].

"[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" has been discussed in a number of academic film studies journals from different perspectives.

[[Alexandra Kapka|PERSON]] analyses [[Buried (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] in the context of its popularity on streaming and piracy web sites, arguing that the loss of the director's introduction on the retail [[DVD|DVD|alias_match_match_candidate]], in which Spasojevich states "[[A Serbian Film|A Serbian Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" is a political allegory, means that [[Buried (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] loses much of its intended meaning.

Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] joined the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party of America|annotation]] in [[1901|DATE]] and was a member in [[Socialist Party of Washington|the party|non_person_coref]]'s [[Socialist Party of Washington|Washington state affiliate|annotation]] until [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] left [[Socialist Party of Washington|the party|non_person_coref]] in the midst of a faction fight.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] then joined the [[Industrial Workers of the World|Industrial Workers of the World|annotation]] ([[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) in [[1909|DATE]], when [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] took part in [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s free speech fights in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane, Washington|annotation]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] became a prominent figure within [[Industrial Workers of the World|the union|non_person_coref]], serving as its representative at an international labor conference in [[Budapest|Budapest|annotation]] in [[1911|DATE]] and a contributor to its papers.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s politics, however, were moving [[William Z. Foster|him|PERSON_coref]] away from the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[William Z. Foster|He|PERSON_coref]] became a committed syndicalist after touring [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1910|DATE]] and [[1911|DATE]], and criticized the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] for not working within established unions or within the workshop in any event.

[[William Z. Foster|He|PERSON_coref]] urged American leftists to enter the [[AFL|ORGANIZATION]] unions, rather than establish rival unions, as the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] had tried to do.

[[William Z. Foster|He|PERSON_coref]] also denounced electoral politics as a dead end that smothered the revolutionary ardor of these groups by channeling their energies into pursuit of office, with all the compromises that entails.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] lost the battle, however, and soon thereafter left the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and formed [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] own organization, the [[Syndicalist League of North America|Syndicalist League of North America|annotation]] ([[Syndicalist League of North America|SLNA|acronym]]).

That is not coincidental, since [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was not only lecturing at anarchist groups and settlements, but became a close working associate with [[Jay Fox|Jay Fox|annotation]], an anarchist with roots in the [[Chicago|Chicago|annotation]] labor movement, and married [[Ester Abramowitz|PERSON]], who had belonged to an anarchist collective in [[Socialist Party of Washington|Washington|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

Among the other members of the SLNA were [[Thomas Mooney|Tom Mooney|annotation]] (who became a labor martyr when imprisoned for allegedly throwing a bomb at a Preparedness [[Day|DURATION]] parade in [[1916|DATE]]), [[Earl Browder|Earl Browder|annotation]], an accountant and union activist in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City|annotation]] and [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s rival for the Presidency of the [[Communism|Communist Party|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[twenty years later|DATE]], and [[James P. Cannon|James P. Cannon|annotation]], a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|annotation]] and [[one|NUMBER]] of [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s allies in the internal warfare within the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] until [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] was expelled for [[Trotskyism|Trotskyism|annotation]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] took [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] own advice and became a union business agent for a local of the [[Brotherhood of Railway Carmen|Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America|annotation]] in [[Chicago|Chicago|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[William Z. Foster|He|PERSON_coref]] continued [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] syndicalist campaign, this time through the [[International Trade Union Educational League|International Trade Union Educational League|annotation]], whi

. [[William Z. Foster|His|PERSON_coref]] syndicalism led [[William Z. Foster|him|PERSON_coref]] to drop any criticism of the more conservative union leaders; in [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] eyes, organizing workers was a step toward dismantling capitalism. The ITUEL did not so much seek to take power in those organizations in which its members were active, as to steer them in a more progressive direction.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] also tempered [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] politics at this time: [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] not only did not publicly oppose the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]]' entry into [[World War I|the war|non_person_coref]], as [[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene V. Debs|annotation]], [[Victor L. Berger|Victor Berger|annotation]] and figures associated with the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] had done, but helped sell war bonds in [[1918|DATE]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] also remained quiet when the government arrested hundreds of [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] activists, convicting them "en masse" in [[1918|DATE]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] did not, on the other hand, become wholly apolitical.

This was an especially propitious time to organize these workers on an industrial basis; as [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] said, "The gods were indeed fighting on the side of labor".

Rather than create a wholly new organization, which would have immediately found itself fighting other unions in the [[Canadian Football League|CFL|alias_match_popular_redirect]] over jurisdiction, [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] hit on the idea of creating a [[Stockyards Labor Council|Stockyards Labor Council|acronym_entity]] ([[Stockyards Labor Council|SLC|acronym]]) that, like the railroad federations that had [[recently|DATE]] come into being, would fuse all of the interested unions into a single body with the ability to organize the industry as a whole.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] obtained the endorsement of [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] union, the Railway [[Carmen|Carmen|PERSON_popular_entity]], for this plan then took the proposal to Local [[87|NUMBER]] of the [[Meat Cutters|ORGANIZATION]], who supported it enthusiastically and obtained the approval of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL|alias_match_popular_redirect]] on [[July 15, 1917|DATE]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was the secretary for the [[Stockyards Labor Council|SLC|acronym_ner]].

While privately convinced that launching a strike under these conditions would be a mistake, and aware that the [[AFL|ORGANIZATION]] leadership felt even more strongly on this subject, [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] nonetheless continued to organize as if a strike was in the offing.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] turned [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] attention, while the packinghouse campaign was still underway, to another project: organizing steel workers.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers|Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers|annotation]], that would organize all of basic steel simultaneously.

Fitzpatrick agreed to put [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] name on the project and sent [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] as the [[Canadian Football League|CFL|alias_match_popular_redirect]]'s delegate to the [[AFL|ORGANIZATION]]'s [[1918|DATE]] convention to [[present|DATE]] the plan.

The [[AFL|ORGANIZATION]]'s reception was tepid: it endorsed a special conference to create a committee to organize steel workers, but each international union contributed only [[one hundred dollars|MONEY]] apiece - leaving the committee with somewhat less than the [[$250,000|MONEY]] [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] estimated it needed.

Many unions did, on the other hand contribute organizers, whom [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] used as [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] base.

Without the funds to launch a truly national campaign, [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] decided to start close to home, sending organizers into [[Gary, Indiana|Gary, Indiana|annotation]], and [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago|annotation]], where they received a tumultuous outpouring of support, in [[August 1918|DATE]].

By the time that [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] sent organizers into that area [[several months later|DATE]], however, the influenza epidemic had led the authorities to bar all public meetings; the announcement of the armistice soon led to widespread layoffs in the mills.

Vigilantes expelled [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] from [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown, Pennsylvania|annotation]], at gunpoint.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] spent most of [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] time raising money and organizing material assistance for strikers and their families.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and the other members of the committee voted to end it in [[January, 1920|DATE]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] resigned from the committee in order to allow it to continue its work "with a clean slate".

After [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] resignation from the [[National Committee|ORGANIZATION]] following the defeat of the steel workers strike, [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was at loose ends.

[[William Z. Foster|He|PERSON_coref]] resigned [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] position as a [[Brotherhood of Railway Carmen|Brotherhood of Railway Carmen|alias_match_match_candidate]] organizer, but was blacklisted from other jobs on the railroad.

[[William Z. Foster|He|PERSON_coref]] still maintained [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] friendship with [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|John Fitzpatrick|alias_match_single_candidate]], wrote a book analyzing the steel strike and founded the [[Trade Union Educational League|Trade Union Educational League|annotation]], which received financial support from the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|annotation]], the left-led union that had contributed [[$100,000|MONEY]] for relief for steel strikers.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] had contacts with a number of members of the newly formed [[Communism|Communist Party|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], but had not joined it after its split from the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party of America|annotation]] in [[1919|DATE]].

im|PERSON]] personally during the strike as an opportunist and class collaborator, calling [[William Z. Foster|him|PERSON_coref]] "E.Z. [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]" for the accommodations [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] was willing to make with the [[AFL|ORGANIZATION]] leadership. The CP at this time was still convinced that the revolution was impending; its suggested slogan during the steel strike was "Make the strike general and seize state power!"

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was brought closer within [[Socialist Party of America|the party|non_person_coref]]'s orbit, however, after [[Earl Browder|Earl Browder|annotation]] invited [[Earl Browder|him|PERSON_coref]] to attend a conference of the [[Profintern|Profintern|annotation]], the [[Profintern|Red International of Labor Unions|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], in [[Moscow|Moscow|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1921|DATE]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] joined the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] on [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] return to the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In its [[early years|DURATION]] [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] pursued a course of its own, not attempting to line up its policies with [[Communist International|Comintern|annotation]] or [[Profintern|Profintern|alias_match_match_candidate]] directives or taking direction from the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

When party leaders complained, the [[Profintern|Profintern|alias_match_match_candidate]] sided with [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]].

The [[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] took pains to avoid accusations of dual unionism; when the [[Profintern|Profintern|alias_match_match_candidate]] requested that [[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] start building itself as a mass membership organization [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] demurred, maintaining [[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] as a network of activists with no formal membership.

[[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was strongest in [[Chicago|Chicago|alias_match_match_candidate]], where [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Jack Johnstone|PERSON]] had close relations with [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|Fitzpatrick|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and many other unionists with a background in labor radicalism.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] had enjoyed a close relationship with [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|John Fitzpatrick|alias_match_single_candidate]] of the [[Chicago Federation of Labor|Chicago Federation of Labor|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Fitzpatrick's project presented [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] with a paradox: [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] did not think that electoral politics had much potential for advancing the rights of workers, much less revolutionary goals, and [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] had even less regard for progressive reformists such as [[Robert M. La Follette|Robert La Follette, Sr.|annotation]].

On the other hand, [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] was attacked from the left within [[Communist Party USA|the party|non_person_coref]] for [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] relations with [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|Fitzpatrick|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL|alias_match_popular_redirect]], which were denounced as too conservative.

Even so, [[John Pepper|John Pepper|annotation]], the [[Communist International|Comintern|annotation]]'s representative in the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], and those, such as [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Charles Ruthenberg|annotation]], who had criticized [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] for [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] closeness to [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|Fitzpatrick|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] [[now|DATE]] directed [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] to make the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] an important player in this new party.

At the same time the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s newspaper, then known as "The Worker", published a flattering article about [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[1923|DATE]] that identified [[William Z. Foster|him|PERSON_coref]] as a [[Communism|Communist|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], something [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] had to that point avoided admitting.

Fitzpatrick began to distance himself from [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] when [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] membership in the [[Communism|Communist Party|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] became public knowledge.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and the CP, on the other hand, had enough influence within the [[Canadian Football League|CFL|alias_match_popular_redirect]] to be able to dominate the founding convention with representatives of various organizations, some of them existing only on paper.

While [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and the CP had enjoyed a close relation with [[Sidney Hillman|Sidney Hillman|annotation]] and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|annotation]], it began organizing an opposition caucus within the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|ACWA|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] profited in a way from this debacle: [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] was able to persuade the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to recall [[John Pepper|Pepper|alias_match_single_candidate]], with whom [[John Pepper|he|PERSON_coref]] had fought over questions of tactics, and the dissolution of the FF-LP was a setback for the [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Charles Ruthenberg|annotation]] - [[Jay Lovestone|Jay Lovestone|annotation]] faction, which was largely made up of foreign-born workers and represented the vast majority of [[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]] membership.

Forming an alliance with a smaller faction led by [[James P. Cannon|James P. Cannon|annotation]], [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was able to control the majority of [[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]]'s leadership in [[1923|DATE]] and again in [[1925|DATE]].

A telegram from the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] directed the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]], after a vote which [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] had won decisively over [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] opponent, [[Benjamin Gitlow|Benjamin Gitlow|annotation]], to install [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Ruthenberg|alias_match_single_candidate]] as general secretary of [[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] challenged the telegram, stormed out of the meeting, and attempted to appeal to the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] itself, over the objections of [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] opponents and even [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] allies in the [[James P. Cannon|Cannon|alias_match_single_candidate]] faction, who would not accept the possibility that the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] could be wrong.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] did not succeed in reversing the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s overturning of [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] election, but did obtain some concessions: [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] supporters were given control of the [[Trade Union Committee|ORGANIZATION]] within [[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]] and the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] recognized trade union work as the most important sphere of activity for the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

While [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] thought that [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] had obtained support for effective independence for [[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], however, [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] was mistaken.

Rivalries within the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] led to the loss of the [[1926|DATE]] [[New York|LOCATION]] dressmakers' strike, as neither the [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] or [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Ruthenberg|alias_match_single_candidate]] faction wanted to appear to sell out by accepting a settlement that the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s members within [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922|the strike|non_person_coref]] leadership had recommended.

The [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Ruthenberg|alias_match_single_candidate]] factions likewise blamed each other for the defeat of the [[1926|DATE]] strike of textile workers in [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic, New Jersey|annotation]], in which the [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Ruthenberg|alias_match_single_candidate]] leadership supported an overt Party role in [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922|the strike|non_person_coref]] and what amounted to creation of a dual union.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] also played a major role in the revolt against [[John L. Lewis|John L. Lewis|annotation]]' leadership in the [[United Mine Workers|United Mine Workers of America|annotation]].

These efforts were leading in the direction of formation of a rival union, something that [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] rejected but which appeared to be the only possibility left to the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

As signals from the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] indicated the impending change of policy in the [[Third Period|Third Period|annotation]], when the American party was directed to abandon its work within the [[AFL|ORGANIZATION]] in order to form separate revolutionary unions, even former supporters of [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]], such as [[Earl Browder|Earl Browder|annotation]], began criticizing [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] for [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] reluctance to form a dual union of miners.

As it turned out, [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s halting efforts to establish a separate power center within the [[United Mine Workers|UMWA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] had this effect in any case, as [[Alexander Howat|Howat|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], [[John Brophy (labor)|Brophy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[John Brophy (labor)|his|PERSON_coref]] allies dropped out of the "Save [[United Mine Workers|the union|non_person_coref]]" movement as the CP's leadership in it became apparent.

The factional fighting between the [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Jay Lovestone|Lovestone|alias_match_single_candidate]] groups continued, but [[now|DATE]] became overshadowed by the larger struggle in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|LOCATION_popular_entity]] between [[Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin|annotation]] and [[Joseph Stalin|his|PERSON_coref]] opponents.

A firm supporter of [[Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin|annotation]], [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] split with [[James P. Cannon|James P. Cannon|annotation]] in [[1928|DATE]] and supported [[James P. Cannon|his|PERSON_coref]] former ally's expulsion for [[Trotskyism|Trotskyism|annotation]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was made General Secretary of [[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]] in [[1929|DATE]] with the support of the [[Communist International|Comintern|annotation]], deposing [[Jay Lovestone|Jay Lovestone|annotation]], who was sympathetic to [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin|annotation]] and whose policies of [[American exceptionalism|American exceptionalism|annotation]] were anathema to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s new [[Third Period|Third Period|annotation]] line.

While [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] had always denounced dual unionism, [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] dutifully complied with the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s directive, renaming the [[Trade Union Educational League|Trade Union Education League|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] as the [[Trade Union Unity League|Trade Union Unity League|annotation]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] also followed the line by denouncing social democrats as "social fascists" and attacking former allies in the [[African Americans|African-American|annotation]] communities as bourgeois collaborators.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] began to lose power within the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]], due to [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] imprisonment during the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s convention in [[1930|DATE]] and [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] continuing differences with others in the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] over trade union policies.

In [[1930|DATE]], [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] ran for [[Governor of New York|Governor of New York|annotation]] on the [[Communism|Communist|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] ticket.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was nominated for President yet again in [[1932|DATE]], but [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and was forced to step down as leader of [[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]] in favor of [[Earl Browder|Earl Browder|annotation]].

Sent to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|LOCATION_popular_entity]] for treatment, [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s condition only grew worse.

A period followed in which [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was separated from political activity.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to politics [[late in 1935|DATE]], but was estranged from [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]] and those who had risen to power in [[Earl Browder|his|PERSON_coref]] absence.

While the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s trade union policies in the [[Popular front|Popular Front|annotation]] era was close to what [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] had advocated in [[the 1920s|DATE]], the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s strength was not in [[South Philadelphia|the area|non_person_coref]]s in which it had been active during the [[Trade Union Educational League|TUEL|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] era - garment, railroads, and mining - but in the mass production industries with little history of union organization - automobile and electrical manufacturing, meatpacking, longshore on the west coast, maritime on the east coast, hard rock mining and lumber in the west and public transit in [[New York City|New York City|annotation]].

In the meantime the [[Communist Party USA|Party|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] began building a small-scale personality cult around [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]] and became a supporter of the [[New Deal|New Deal|annotation]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt|annotation]] administration both of which [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was critical.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] became the "loyal opposition" to [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]] within the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] while remaining an unwavering supporter of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] had, in fact, been [[one|NUMBER]] of the most vocal opponents in [[1944|DATE]] of [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s decisions to rename the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Political Association|annotation]] and to propose the continuation of the no-strike pledge after the end of [[World War I|World War|alias_match_single_candidate]] II.

The entire leadership of [[Communist Party USA|the party|non_person_coref]] came to [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s defense then; the [[Communist International|Comintern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] directed [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] to withdraw [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] criticisms.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s letter to the [[National Committee|ORGANIZATION]] subsequently formed the basis for the [[Jacques Duclos|Duclos letter|annotation]] published as the [[Cold War|Cold War|annotation]] began in [[1945|DATE]] that signaled the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|LOCATION_popular_entity]]'s change in line.

[[Communist International|the party|non_person_coref]] members who had denounced [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] and questioned [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] grasp of Marxism and [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] mental faculties [[a year earlier|DATE]] [[now|DATE]] condemned [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]] as a class traitor.

While [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] nominally shared power with [[Eugene Dennis|Eugene Dennis|annotation]] and [[John Williamson (communist)|John Williamson|annotation]], [[John Williamson (communist)|he|PERSON_coref]] had the most prestige of the [[three|NUMBER]].

During [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]]'s leadership [[Communist Party USA|the party|non_person_coref]] took a harder line, both internationally and internally, shedding much of the "Americanist" rhetoric of [[Earl Browder|Browder|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s [[dozen years|DURATION]] in leadership.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] published a 'new history' of [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], which was highly praised in [[Moscow|Moscow|alias_match_popular_entity]] and was translated into many languages.

In [[1948|DATE]] [[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] was among [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|the party|non_person_coref]] leaders indicted for subversive activity under the [[Smith Act|Smith Act|annotation]], but, because of [[William Z. Foster|his|PERSON_coref]] precarious health, [[William Z. Foster|he|PERSON_coref]] was not brought to trial.

[[William Z. Foster|Foster|alias_match_article_entity]] also presided over a number of internal purges.

[[Pauline Cafferkey|She|PERSON_coref]] survived the illness.

On [[29 December 2014|DATE]], [[Pauline Cafferkey|Cafferkey|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], who had just returned to [[Glasgow|Glasgow|annotation]] from [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|alias_match_match_candidate]] via [[Mohammed V International Airport|Casablanca Airport|annotation]] and [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport|annotation]], was diagnosed with [[Ebola|Ebola virus disease|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] at [[Glasgow|Glasgow|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[Gartnavel General Hospital|Gartnavel General Hospital|annotation]].

[[Pauline Cafferkey|She|PERSON_coref]] had been working at an [[Ebola|Ebola|alias_match_match_candidate]] treatment centre in [[Kerry Town|LOCATION]] in [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|alias_match_match_candidate]], and it is thought [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] contracted the virus as a result of wearing a visor, as recommended by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization|annotation]] and the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence|annotation]], instead of goggles.

After initial treatment in [[Glasgow|Glasgow|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was transferred by air to [[RAF Northolt|RAF Northolt|annotation]], then to the specialist high-level isolation unit at the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free Hospital|annotation]] in [[London|London|annotation]] for longer-term treatment.

Contact tracing was carried out on the other passengers who traveled on the flight from [[London|London|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[Glasgow|Glasgow|alias_match_match_candidate]] with [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]].

Medical staff described [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] condition at the [[time|DATE]] as "as well as we can hope for at this stage."

On [[4 January 2015|DATE]], the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free Hospital|alias_match_match_candidate]] announced that [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] condition had deteriorated to critical, with [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] health later stabilising before [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was declared no longer critically ill on [[12 January|DATE]].

Cafferkey received blood plasma from [[William Pooley|PERSON]] and has been treated with experimental drugs as part of [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] treatment.

On [[24 January|DATE]], [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was declared to be free of infection, and released from hospital.

In a media interview in [[September 2015|DATE]], [[Pauline Cafferkey|Cafferkey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] said "I’ve had trouble with my thyroid, lost some of my hair and get really sore joints but I guess side effects are to be expected."

[[24 hours later|DATE]] [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was admitted to [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|annotation]] where [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was diagnosed with late complications caused by the [[Ebola|Ebola virus|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] hitherto considered unusual, and was flown by military jet to [[London|London|alias_match_match_candidate]], to the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free Hospital|annotation]].

[[Pauline Cafferkey|Her|PERSON_coref]] condition was initially described as serious and [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was being treated in the high-level isolation unit.

Doctors discovered that, after [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] had been deemed cured, the virus had remained in [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] cerebrospinal fluid and feared that it might be in [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] central nervous system.

Personnel in [[Scotland|Scotland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] monitored those whom [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] had come into contact with, since the virus can be spread through exposure to the infected person's body fluids, though they said the risk was likely to be small.

Cafferkey's condition declined rapidly, and on [[14 October 2015|DATE]] [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was reported to be critically ill.

[[Five days later|DATE]], on [[19 October 2015|DATE]], the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free Hospital|annotation]] announced that: "[[Pauline Cafferkey|Pauline Cafferkey|alias_match_article_entity]]'s condition has improved to serious but stable".

On [[12 November|DATE]] the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free Hospital|alias_match_match_candidate]] said that [[Pauline Cafferkey|Cafferkey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had made a full recovery and was no longer infectious.

[[Pauline Cafferkey|She|PERSON_coref]] was transferred to [[Glasgow|Glasgow|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|annotation]].

In a statement the [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] said [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] had been transferred to [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|the hospital|non_person_coref]] "due to a late complication from [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] previous infection by the [[Ebola|Ebola virus|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]" and that [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was being treated by [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|the hospital|non_person_coref]]'s infectious diseases team.

On [[24 February|DATE]] [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|the hospital|non_person_coref]] described [[Pauline Cafferkey|her|PERSON_coref]] condition as "stable".

A spokesman said, "We can confirm that [[Pauline Cafferkey|Pauline|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] is not infectious.

On [[6 October 2016|DATE]] [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was readmitted to the [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|Queen Elizabeth University Hospital|annotation]] to be monitored by the infectious diseases team.

A [[NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde|NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde|annotation]] spokeswoman said that [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was in a stable condition and undergoing investigations.

In [[2014|DATE]], due to the fact that [[Pauline Cafferkey|Cafferkey|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] had passed through border controls and travelled on a domestic flight from [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to [[Glasgow|Glasgow|alias_match_match_candidate]], criticism was levelled at [[current|DATE]] screening protocols at [[United Kingdom|UK|alias_match_popular_redirect]] points of entry, which mainly consisted of taking a person's temperature and asking a series of questions.

In [[2016|DATE]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|Nursing and Midwifery Council|annotation]] initiated proceedings against Cafferkey, alleging that [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] had allowed an incorrect temperature to be recorded during the screening process upon returning to the [[United Kingdom|UK|alias_match_popular_redirect]] from [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[2014|DATE]].

Following a [[two-day|DURATION]] hearing in [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh|LOCATION_popular_entity]] during [[September 2016|DATE]], the charges against Cafferkey were dismissed and [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] was cleared of any wrongdoing.

The disciplinary panel was told that [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] had been impaired by illness at the [[time|DATE]] and heard evidence about how the [[Public Health England|Public Health England|annotation]] screening centre at [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport|annotation]] had been unprepared for a large influx of passengers and that it was "busy, disorganised and even chaotic".

[[BBC Scotland|BBC Scotland|annotation]] reporter [[Philip Sim|PERSON]] wrote: "It [[now|DATE]] seems as if the case against [[Pauline Cafferkey|Pauline Cafferkey|alias_match_article_entity]] had fallen apart before the hearing even began - raising questions as to why [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] had to go through it in the [[first|ORDINAL]] place".

Wood was suspended for [[two months|DURATION]] for failing to alert the authorities about [[Pauline Cafferkey|Cafferkey|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s condition.

In [[April 2017|DATE]], [[Pauline Cafferkey|Cafferkey|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] announced [[Pauline Cafferkey|she|PERSON_coref]] would return to [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[May|DATE]] to raise funds for [[Ebola|Ebola|alias_match_match_candidate]] survivors and children orphaned by the disease.

[[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] is a temple town, with the [[Nataraja|Nataraja|alias_match_match_candidate]] complex spread over [[40|NUMBER]] acre within a nearly square courtyard in the center.

The [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja temple|alias_match_article_entity]] has ancient roots, likely following [[Hindu temple|the temple|non_person_coref]] architecture tradition that is found all over South [[India|India|alias_match_match_candidate]] from at least [[the 5th century|DATE]].

Textual evidence, such as those of the Sangam tradition, suggest a temple existed here along with [[Madurai|Madurai|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in ancient times, but [[Chidambaram|the town|non_person_coref]] is not named [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] in these pre-5th-century texts.

The earliest mention of "dancing god of [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]]" as [[Shiva|Shiva|alias_match_match_candidate]] is found in [[6th|ORDINAL]]- and early-7th-century texts by Appar and Sambadar.

The surviving [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja temple|alias_match_article_entity]] has a structure that is traceable to the early Chola dynasty.

[[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] was the early capital of this dynasty, and [[Nataraja|Shiva Nataraja|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was their family deity.

The [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram temple|alias_match_article_entity]] town remained important to the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], albeit with increasing competition from other temple towns when [[Rajaraja Chola|PERSON]] I moved the capital to [[Thanjavur|Thanjavur|annotation]], built a new city and the massive [[Brihadisvara Temple, Thanjavur|Brihadeeswarar Temple|annotation]] dedicated to [[Shiva|Shiva|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[early 11th century|DATE]], which is [[now|DATE]] a world heritage site.

The earliest historically verifiable [[Shiva|Shiva temple|alias_match_single_candidate]] at [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] is traceable in inscriptions that date to the rule of [[Surya|Aditya|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Chola I in [[the early 10th century|DATE]], and far more during the rule of the 10th-century Chola king Parantaka I. For them, the dancing [[Shiva|Shiva|alias_match_match_candidate]] was the "kula-nayaka" (family guide or deity) and [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] was the capital they built.

[[Ponnambalam|He|PERSON_coref]] is referred to as "Pon veinda [[Vishnu|Perumal|alias_match_single_candidate]]", which means "[[one|NUMBER]] who covered with gold" the Chit-sabha of [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram temple|alias_match_article_entity]] thrived during the [[Chola dynasty|Chola|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] dynasty rule through [[mid 13th century|DATE]], along with the later [[Shiva|Shiva|alias_match_match_candidate]]-based [[Thanjavur|Thanjavur|alias_match_match_candidate]] and Gangaikondacholapuram capitals, as well as [[Vishnu|Vishnu|alias_match_match_candidate]]-based [[Srirangam|Srirangam|annotation]] temple towns.

Naralokaviran, the general of king [[Kulottunga I|Kulothunga Chola I|annotation]] was responsible for building the steps that lead to Sivaganga water pool, a goddess shrine, a shrine for child saint [[Sambandar|Thirugnana Sambanthar|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], temple gardens and a pilgrim road network in and around [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]].

The [[Hindus|Hindu|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Pandyas were liberal supporters of [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram temple|alias_match_article_entity]], along with other [[Shiva|Shiva|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Vishnu|Vishnu temples|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], just like the [[Chola dynasty|Chola|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

A large number of these were rediscovered in archaeological excavations at the site in and after [[1979|DATE]], including those in [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]].

The Islamic invasion in [[the 14th century|DATE]], states [[George Michell|PERSON]] – a professor and art historian of [[India|Indian|alias_match_single_candidate]] architecture, brought an abrupt end to the patronage of [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] and other temple towns.

These kings themselves went on pilgrimage to [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]], and gifted resources to strengthen its walls and infrastructure.

The destruction of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara Empire|annotation]] in [[the late 16th century|DATE]] by an alliance of Sultanates, followed within [[a few decades|DURATION]] by entrance of Portuguese, French and British colonial interests brought geopolitical uncertainties to [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] and other temple towns.

The Portuguese were already a major [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel Coast|annotation]] trading group by [[the early 17th century|DATE]], a region to which [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] belonged.

According to British reports, [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram temple|alias_match_article_entity]] town had to bear the "brunt of several severe onslaughts" between the French and the British colonial forces several times particularly in [[the 18th century|DATE]].

The [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram temple|alias_match_article_entity]] legend is contained in the 12th-century text "Chidambara-mahatmya".

[[Two|NUMBER]] sages named [[Patanjali|Patanjali|annotation]] (also called Sesha-bodied in the south for [[Malik Kafur|his|PERSON_coref]] connection to [[Vishnu|Vishnu|alias_match_match_candidate]]) and [[Vyaghrapada|PERSON]] (also called Tiger-footed sage) want to see the repeat performance of this "dance of bliss" in the Thaillai forest, [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]].

Their asceticism impresses [[Shiva|Shiva|alias_match_match_candidate]] who appeared before them in [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Chidambaram|alias_match_article_entity]] and performed "the dance" against "the wall, in the blessed hall of consciousness".

[[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]] did not exist as a brand in its home market until [[2005|DATE]], and all vehicles marketed internationally as [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]] from [[1989|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[2005|DATE]] were released in [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] under the [[Toyota|Toyota|alias_match_match_candidate]] marque and an equivalent model name.

[[Beginning in 1989|DATE]], television ads were narrated by actor [[James Sloyan|James Sloyan|annotation]] (the voice of "Mr. [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]]" until [[2009|DATE]]), and accompanied by vehicles that performed unusual stunts onscreen.

[[The first decade|DURATION]] of [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]] commercials ([[1989|DATE]]–[[99|NUMBER]]) consisted primarily of disjunctive verbal descriptions, such as "relentless," "pursuit," and "perfection," while vehicles were used to claim superiority in precision, idling, and interior quiet and comfort on camera.

An annual "[[December|DATE]] to Remember" campaign featured scenes of family members surprising loved ones with the gift of a new [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]].

Industry observers have attributed [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]]' early marketing successes to higher levels of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors, which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass-market cars.

Automotive analysts have also noted [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]]' relative newcomer status as a marketing challenge for the brand, although some have debated the requirement of a long history.

European rivals have marketed their [[decades|DURATION]] of heritage and pedigree, whereas [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]]' reputation rests primarily upon its perceived quality and shared history with parent company [[Toyota|Toyota|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Several analysts have stated that [[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]] will have to develop its own heritage over time by highlighting technological innovations and producing substantial products.

[[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]]' marketing efforts have extended to sporting and charity event sponsorships, including the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open|annotation]] tennis Grand Slam event from [[2005|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[2009|DATE]], and the [[United States Golf Association|United States Golf Association|annotation]]'s [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open|annotation]], [[U.S. Women's Open|U.S. Women's Open|annotation]], [[U.S. Senior Open|U.S. Senior Open|annotation]], and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur|annotation]] tournaments since [[2007|DATE]].

[[Lexus|Lexus|alias_match_article_entity]] has organized an annual Champions for Charity golf series in the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] since [[1989|DATE]].

Mandalorians

[[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|annotation]] are fictional people associated with the planet [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|annotation]] in the "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|annotation]]" universe and franchise created by [[George Lucas|George Lucas|annotation]].

Although Fett was not explicitly identified as a [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] in the film, [[Boba Fett|his|PERSON_coref]] popularity inspired an extensive inquisition into [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[future|DATE]] "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]]" media, including novels, comics, television series, and video games.

The "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]]" expanded universe and the television series "[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars|annotation]]", "[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels|annotation]]", and "[[The Mandalorian|The Mandalorian|annotation]]" expanded upon [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] lore with the introduction of additional characters, and established the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] not as an "alien race or species", but a distinct ethnicity of human people from [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] and nearby worlds united by a common creed with a stoic, spartan warrior tradition.

In production for "[[The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back|annotation]]" ([[1980|DATE]]), [[Ralph McQuarrie|Ralph McQuarrie|annotation]] and [[Joe Johnston|Joe Johnston|annotation]] designed armor intended to be worn by soldiers described as super-commandos from the [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] system, armed with weapons built into white suits and known for battling the [[Jedi|Jedi|annotation]].

The backstory of the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[first|ORDINAL]] extensively explored in issues of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics|annotation]]' original "[[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Star Wars|annotation]]" series and various other "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]] Legends" media, including comics by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse|annotation]] and video games by [[LucasArts|LucasArts|annotation]].

"[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|annotation]]" ([[2002|DATE]]) introduces [[Boba Fett|the bounty hunter|non_person_coref]] [[Jango Fett|Jango Fett|annotation]], who also wore [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian armor|alias_match_article_entity]], and was the adoptive father of [[Boba Fett|Boba|alias_match_single_candidate]], a clone of [[Jango Fett|Jango|alias_match_single_candidate]].

More spin-off material explored [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] lore, including the violent Death Watch sect.

Only the films and spin-off works produced after [[April 25, 2014|DATE]], are part of the restructured canon, including television series such as "[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars|annotation]]", "[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels|annotation]]", and "[[The Mandalorian|The Mandalorian|annotation]]", the latter of which heavily focuses on the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] creed.

[[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] made their live action cinematic debut in "[[The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back|annotation]]" ([[1980|DATE]]), with [[Boba Fett|the bounty hunter|non_person_coref]] [[Boba Fett|Boba Fett|annotation]], a supporting antagonist.

[[Jango Fett|Jango|alias_match_single_candidate]] is also a bounty hunter who is not explicitly identified as a [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] in the film, but wears [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian armor|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[Boba Fett|Boba|alias_match_single_candidate]] would eventually create a suit in its likeness); in "[[The Mandalorian|The Mandalorian|annotation]]", [[Boba Fett|Boba|alias_match_single_candidate]] refers to [[Boba Fett|his|PERSON_coref]] father as a [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] foundling.

The animated series "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" expands upon [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] lore with the introduction of new characters, such as [[Duchess Satine Kryze|PERSON]], the pacifist leader of [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] and a romantic interest for [[Jedi|Jedi Master|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi|annotation]], and [[Pre Vizsla|LOCATION]], the leader of the Death Watch faction of [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] that seeks to overthrow Satine and restore [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]]'s warrior traditions.

[[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] is depicted as the fictional home planet of the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] people, located in the Outer Rim in the sector and system of the same name.

It has an inhabited moon called [[Concordia|ORGANIZATION]], a mining settlement to which [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] warriors were exiled.

Concord Dawn, located in the [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] sector, is also the homeworld of several [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] characters, including [[Jango Fett|Jango Fett|alias_match_match_candidate]], and the base of operations for the Protectors.

In "[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]", the planet [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] is a largely uninhabitable desert, caused by a war with the [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]] that occurred before the timeframe of the series.

The New [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] people built their cities, such as the capital [[Sundari|ORGANIZATION]], in large biodomes.

The concept of [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] as a "large desolate planet of white sand with these cube-like buildings" was developed by [[George Lucas|Lucas|alias_match_single_candidate]] early in development for "[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]" season [[two|NUMBER]].

By the time of "[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars Rebels|annotation]]", [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] have colonized other worlds, such as [[Concord Dawn|ORGANIZATION]] and Krownest.

The [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] eventually came into contact with the [[Old Republic|ORGANIZATION]] and fought their [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]] protectors.

Upon seeing the [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s force abilities, the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] created gadgets, weapons and armor to counter [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]] abilities.

Despite the animosity between the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] and the [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Tarre Vizsla|LOCATION]] became the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]].

During "[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars Rebels|alias_match_match_candidate]]", a [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] named [[Sabine Wren|PERSON]] of [[Clan Wren|PERSON]] discovers the Darksaber while fighting Darth Maul.

With the Darksaber, [[she|PERSON]] hoped to unite [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] and get [[her|PERSON]] honor back after creating a weapon that would kill [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]].

Upon returning to [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]], [[she|PERSON]] gained the support of [[her|PERSON]] estranged mother [[Ursa|LOCATION]].

After [[Clan Saxon|PERSON]] is defeated, the Empire seemingly backs off from [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]], and [[Sabine|ORGANIZATION]] renounces ownership of the Darksaber to [[Bo-Katan Kryze|PERSON]], sister of the late Duchess Satine Kryze, who promises to unite all [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] clans under [[her|PERSON]] leadership and restore peace to [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]].

At some point during the Galactic Civil War, the [[The Empire Strikes Back|Empire|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] returned to [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] and purged the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] people, leaving only a few surviving clans; this event became known as the "Great Purge" among [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]].

"[[The Mandalorian|The Mandalorian|annotation]]" follows the exploits of [[The Mandalorian (character)|Din Djarin|annotation]], aka the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] or simply "Mando," a [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] bounty hunter and member of [[one|NUMBER]] such clan, called "The Tribe", which is later exterminated by a remnant of the Empire led by [[Moff Gideon|Moff Gideon|annotation]], who was personally involved in the [[Great Purge|Great Purge|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and obtained the Darksaber from Bo-Katan after defeating [[her|PERSON]] in combat.

During the show's [[second|ORDINAL]] season, it is revealed that Bo-Katan, along with a small number of [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] warriors willing to follow [[her|PERSON]], is attempting to reclaim the Darksaber and liberate [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] from Imperial occupation.

It is also implied that [[Djarin|PERSON]] will be helping Bo-Katan and [[her|PERSON]] forces liberate [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] in exchange for their assistance in taking down [[Moff Gideon|Gideon|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]].

The show introduces the concept of [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] foundlings: children who are not born [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]], but found and adopted into the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] culture, with [[Djarin|PERSON]] and the alien toddler that [[Moff Gideon|he|PERSON_coref]] adopts, [[Grogu|Grogu|annotation]], being [[two|NUMBER]] such foundlings.

According to [[Bo-Katan Kryze|PERSON]] in "[[Chapter 11: The Heiress|Chapter 11: The Heiress|annotation]]", [[Djarin|PERSON]] was found by the "Children of the Watch", a tribe of religious zealots who follow the ancient "Way of the [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]]", consisting of various forgotten [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] traditions, such as never removing their helmets in front of others; they were excluded from the mainsteam of [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] society for trying to spread their beliefs.

Within the "Legends" continuity, the name "[[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]]" is associated with a multi-species culture of warrior clans who adhere to the tenets of the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]].

While most of them are humans, there are also [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] of various other species.

s_match_article_entity]] serves as the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]]' home planet

. It was originally inhabited by the Taung species, who renamed themselves [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] and created the culture practiced by later non-Taung [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]]

. [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] is largely sparsely populated wilderness, and its capital city of Keldabe is located on a river that acts as a natural moat. Keldabe is described as an "anarchic fortress" characterized by dissimilar architectural styles.

[[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] debuted in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#68|MONEY]]: "The Search Begins", which describes the super-commandos, the official protectors of the planet [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]].

In "[[Tales of the Jedi|Tales of the Jedi|annotation]]", set [[thousands of years|DURATION]] before the original "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]]" film, the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] are a major military power who side with the [[Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|Sith|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] in their war against the [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]], and their leader is manipulated by the Sith into triggering a war with the Republic.

They are defeated with the aid of [[Revan|Revan|annotation]] and [[Malak|PERSON]], and [[Revan|Revan|alias_match_match_candidate]] ensures a new Mand'alor, the sole ruler of the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] people, cannot rise.

Their unity as a people dissolved, the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] develop into a culture of wandering mercenaries.

"[[Jango Fett|Jango Fett|alias_match_match_candidate]]: Open Seasons", set shortly before the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Clone Wars|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], depicts the fighting between [[two|NUMBER]] factions: Death Watch, led by [[Tor Vizsla|LOCATION]], and the True [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]], led by [[Jango Fett|Jango Fett|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s adoptive father [[Jaster Mereel|PERSON]] and later [[Jango Fett|Jango|alias_match_single_candidate]] himself.

A ruse orchestrated by [[Vizsla|LOCATION]] tricks the [[Jedi|Jedi|alias_match_match_candidate]] into attacking and killing all of the True [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] except [[Jango Fett|Jango|alias_match_single_candidate]], but [[Jango Fett|Jango|alias_match_single_candidate]] eventually kills [[Vizsla|LOCATION]] and scatters Death Watch.

In the "[[Star Wars: Republic Commando|Republic Commando|annotation]]" novels, set during the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Clone Wars|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] is an independent planet, although many [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] warriors fight for the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Separatists|alias_match_single_candidate]].

However, a group of [[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] had also acted as training sergeants for the clone trooper army under the direction of [[Jango Fett|Jango Fett|alias_match_match_candidate]], and many clone troopers practice [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] customs and traditions.

After the establishment of the [[Galactic Empire|ORGANIZATION]], the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] people are characterized as wary of and reluctant to aid the Empire but unwilling to declare open rebellion because [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] lacks the resources to wage war.

[[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] and its people reappear again in the "[[Legacy of the Force|Legacy of the Force|annotation]]" novels, set [[forty years|DURATION]] after the original "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]]" film, where [[Boba Fett|Boba Fett|alias_match_match_candidate]] is convinced by [[Boba Fett|his|PERSON_coref]] granddaughter [[Mirta Gev|PERSON]] to assume the title of "Mand'alor" and again reunite the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] people.

In the video game "[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|annotation]]", set roughly [[4000 years|DURATION]] before the original "[[Star Wars|Star Wars|alias_match_match_candidate]]" film, the [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] leader (referred to as [[Mandalorians|Mandalore|alias_match_article_entity]] the Great) rules over all [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] clans.

[[Mandalorians|Mandalorians|alias_match_article_entity]] are also [[present|DATE]] in the sequels: "[[Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|annotation]]", where players can visit a [[Mandalorians|Mandalorian|alias_match_article_entity]] base on a moon called D'xun, and "[[Star Wars: The Old Republic|The Old Republic|annotation]]", an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG|annotation]] set almost [[four centuries|DURATION]] after the previous [[two|NUMBER]] games.

"La Tribune" was eventually acquired by [[Power Corporation of Canada|Power Corporation of Canada|annotation]], which sold [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Telemedia|Telemedia|annotation]] in [[1968|DATE]].

When [[CKSH-DT|CKSH-TV|annotation]] went on the air on [[September 19, 1974|DATE]], it took all [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada|alias_match_popular_redirect]] programming away from [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Sherbrooke|Sherbrooke|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s anglophone population was too small for [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]] to be viable as a privately owned [[CBC Television|CBC Television|alias_match_match_candidate]] affiliate.

[[Five years later|DATE]], [[Réseau Pathonic|Pathonic Communications|annotation]] acquired [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[four|NUMBER]] other stations from [[Telemedia|Telemedia|alias_match_match_candidate]].

As a result, since [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]]'s over-the-air signal reaches [[Montreal|Montreal|alias_match_match_candidate]], it was carried on CF Cable and [[Vidéotron|Vidéotron|annotation]] in that city.

Since then, [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]] has been basically a semi-satellite of [[CFTM-DT|CFTM|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], except for newscasts and commercials.

CF Cable stopped carrying [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[the early 1990s|DATE]], and [[Vidéotron|Vidéotron|alias_match_match_candidate]] followed suit in [[1995|DATE]].

During the analogue era, [[CHLT-DT|CHLT|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of [[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]'s most powerful stations; its terrestrial footprint extended as far as northwestern [[Maine|Maine|annotation]].

Montague James

[[Montague James|Montague James|annotation]] (d. c. [[1812|DATE]]) was a [[Maroons|Maroon|annotation]] leader of [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)|Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)|annotation]] in [[the last decade|DATE]] of eighteenth-century [[Jamaica|Jamaica|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

When the [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|Jamaican Assembly|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] dismissed [[John James|John James|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] and [[John James|his|PERSON_coref]] son from the superintendency of [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)|Trelawny Town|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and appointed the inexperienced [[Thomas Craskell|PERSON]] as superintendent, then [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] took control of [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)|Trelawny Town|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and dismissed Craskell from [[Thomas Craskell|his|PERSON_coref]] post.

It is possible that [[Maroons|Maroon|alias_match_single_candidate]] colonel [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] took [[Thomas Craskell|his|PERSON_coref]] name from that of the son of [[John James|John James|PERSON_human_disambiguation]], the white superintendent John [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]].

This action outraged the [[Maroons|Maroons|alias_match_match_candidate]] of [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)|Trelawny Town|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and led to [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] ousting Craskell, and renewing calls for more land, and the reinstatement of [[John James|his|PERSON_coref]] friend, [[John James|John James|PERSON_human_disambiguation]], as superintendent.

Instead, [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] told [[John James|his|PERSON_coref]] warriors how badly [[John James|he|PERSON_coref]] had been treated, and the [[Jamaican Maroons|Jamaican Maroons|annotation]] burnt their towns, and retreated into the [[Cockpit Country|Cockpit Country|annotation]] to carry out a campaign of guerrilla warfare.

Hundreds of runaway slaves secured their freedom by fighting for [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)|Trelawny Town|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] was served by a number of able lieutenants, who were able to conduct a successful guerrilla campaign, including [[Major Jarrett|Major Jarrett|annotation]], [[Andrew Smith (officer)|Andrew Smith (Maroon)|annotation]], [[Charles Samuels (maroon)|Charles Samuels (Maroon)|annotation]], [[Leonard Parkinson|PERSON]] and [[James Palmer|James Palmer|PERSON_human_disambiguation]].

[[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] then threatened to kill cattle for food, and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|he|PERSON_coref]] incurred a standoff with troops sent by [[Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet|John Wentworth (governor)|annotation]].

In [[1800|DATE]], [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]] eventually got [[Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet|his|PERSON_coref]] way, and the [[Maroons|Maroons|alias_match_match_candidate]] secured a passage to [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|annotation]].

In [[1801|DATE]], [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]], already an old man, was granted a pension by the colonial government of [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In [[1809|DATE]], [[Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone|alias_match_match_candidate]] Governor [[Thomas Perronet Thompson|Thomas Perronet Thompson|annotation]] officially appointed [[Montague James|Montague James|alias_match_article_entity]], still the unofficial leader of the [[Maroons|Maroons|alias_match_match_candidate]], a de facto one-man provisional government of the [[Maroons|Maroons|alias_match_match_candidate]].

When [[Dan Fitzpatrick|his|PERSON_coref]] wife became pregnant with their [[first|ORDINAL]] child, [[Dan Fitzpatrick|Fitzpatrick|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] decided [[Dan Fitzpatrick|he|PERSON_coref]] would start writing a book to pass on to [[Dan Fitzpatrick|his|PERSON_coref]] children.

Initially, [[Dan Fitzpatrick|he|PERSON_coref]] planned to write an extensive family biography which would include the genealogy, significant events, and most noted memories.

After [[a few months|DURATION]] of extensive research, [[Dan Fitzpatrick|he|PERSON_coref]] came up short handed and decide to abandon the story.

Since [[Dan Fitzpatrick|he|PERSON_coref]] had no way to properly express [[Dan Fitzpatrick|his|PERSON_coref]] disgust towards these violent criminals, [[Dan Fitzpatrick|he|PERSON_coref]] decided to put [[Dan Fitzpatrick|his|PERSON_coref]] rage into a story.

Terminal High Altitude Area Defense

[[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|annotation]] ([[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|annotation]]), formerly [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|Theater High Altitude Area Defense|annotation]], is an American anti-ballistic missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase (descent or reentry) by intercepting with a hit-to-kill approach.

. The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] interceptor carries no warhead, but relies on its kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. A kinetic energy hit minimizes the risk of exploding conventional-warhead ballistic missiles, and [[Gulf War|the war|non_person_coref]]head of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles will not detonate upon a kinetic-energy hit.

Originally a [[United States Army|United States Army|annotation]] program, [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] has come under the umbrella of the [[Missile Defense Agency|Missile Defense Agency|annotation]].

[[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] was originally scheduled for deployment in [[2012|DATE]], but initial deployment took place in [[May 2008|DATE]].

[[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] has been deployed in [[Guam|Guam|annotation]], the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates|annotation]], [[Israel|Israel|annotation]], [[Romania|Romania|annotation]], and [[South Korea|South Korea|annotation]].

The vulnerability and lethality analyses of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] have been conducted by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)|annotation]].

The vulnerability assessment for the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] featured an evaluation of the effects of major electromagnetic elements.

This included EM interference, EM radiation operations, EM radiation hazards, EM pulse, electrostatic discharge, and lightning effects on components of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system.

The [[United States Army Research Laboratory|ARL|alias_match_single_candidate]] assessments were designed to determine the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system's growth potential given its tactical design as well as provide survivability analysis against threats such as conventional weapons, chemical weapons, and electronic warfare countermeasures.

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system is being designed, built, and integrated by [[Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control|Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control|annotation]] acting as prime contractor.

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] missile defense concept was proposed in [[1987|DATE]], with a formal request for proposals submitted to industry in [[1991|DATE]].

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] program benefited from results of previous missile defense efforts like [[High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor|High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor|acronym_entity]] ([[High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor|HEDI|acronym]]) and the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Integrated Technology Experiment (KITE).

In [[September 1992|DATE]], the [[United States Army|US Army|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] selected [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed|annotation]] ([[now|DATE]] [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin|annotation]]) as prime contractor for [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] development.

The [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] flight test occurred in [[April 1995|DATE]], with all flight tests in the demonstration-validation (DEM-VAL) program phase occurring at [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Missile Range|annotation]].

[[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] is pushing for funding for the development of an extended-range (ER) version of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] to counter maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese [[DF-ZF|WU-14|annotation]], to penetrate the gap between low- and high-altitude missile defenses.

[[Lockheed Martin|the company|non_person_coref]] performed static fire trials of a modified [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] booster in [[2006|DATE]] and continued to fund the project until [[2008|DATE]].

As of [[2020|DATE]], [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]]-ER is only an industry concept, but [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] believes that the [[Missile Defense Agency|Missile Defense Agency|alias_match_match_candidate]] will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries.

If funding for the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]]-ER begins in [[2020|DATE]], a system could be produced by [[2024|DATE]] to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat.

Sometimes called Kinetic Kill technology, the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] missile destroys missiles by colliding with them, using hit-to-kill technology, like the [[MIM-104 Patriot|MIM-104 Patriot|annotation]] [[MIM-104 Patriot|PAC-3|alias_match_single_candidate]] (although the [[MIM-104 Patriot|PAC-3|alias_match_single_candidate]] also contains a small explosive warhead).

Although the actual figures are classified, [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] missiles have an estimated range of [[125|NUMBER]] miles ([[200|NUMBER]] km), and can reach an altitude of [[93|NUMBER]] miles ([[150|NUMBER]] km).

A [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] battery consists of at least [[six|NUMBER]] launcher vehicles, each equipped with [[eight|NUMBER]] missiles, with [[two|NUMBER]] mobile tactical operations centers (TOCs) and the [[TPY-2|AN/TPY-2|annotation]] ground-based radar (GBR); the [[United States Army|U.S. Army|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] plans to field at least [[six|NUMBER]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] batteries, at a purchase cost of [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]$800 million per battery.

In [[June 2020|DATE]] the [[Senate Armed Services Committee|ORGANIZATION]] draft of the FY2021 DoD budget allocated funding for the [[eighth|ORDINAL]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] battery.

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] missile is manufactured at a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin|alias_match_match_candidate]] facility near [[Troy, Alabama|Troy, Alabama|annotation]].

The facility performs final integration, assembly and testing of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] missile.

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] Radar is an [[X band|X-Band|annotation]] active electronically scanned array Radar developed and built by [[Raytheon Technologies|Raytheon|annotation]] at its [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover, Massachusetts|annotation]] Integrated Air Defense Facility.

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar and a variant developed as a forward sensor for ICBM missile defense, the Forward-Based [[X band|X-Band|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] – Transportable (FBX-T) radar, were assigned a common designator, [[TPY-2|AN/TPY-2|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], in late [[2006/early|DATE]] [[2007|DATE]].

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar can interoperate with [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System|Aegis|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot|alias_match_single_candidate]] systems, in a 3-layer antimissile defense.

At the [[time|DATE]], the battery had [[24|NUMBER]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] interceptors, [[three|NUMBER]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] launchers based on the [[M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System|M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System|annotation]], a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] Fire Control and a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar.

On [[16 October 2009|DATE]], the [[United States Army|U.S. Army|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and the [[Missile Defense Agency|Missile Defense Agency|alias_match_match_candidate]] activated the [[second|ORDINAL]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|alias_match_article_entity]] Battery, [[Alpha Battery|ORGANIZATION]], [[2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|ORGANIZATION]] (A-2), at [[Fort Bliss|Fort Bliss|alias_match_match_candidate]].

On [[15 August 2012|DATE]], [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] received a [[$150 million|MONEY]] contract from the [[Missile Defense Agency|Missile Defense Agency|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Missile Defense Agency|MDA|alias_match_single_candidate]]) to produce [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] Weapon System launchers and fire control and communications equipment for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

The contract provided [[six|NUMBER]] launchers for [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] Battery [[5|NUMBER]] and an additional [[three|NUMBER]] launchers each to Batteries [[1|NUMBER]] and [[2|NUMBER]].

In [[May 2017|DATE]], the [[Pentagon|ORGANIZATION]] proposed spending [[$7.9 billion|MONEY]] in its FY [[2018|DATE]] budget on missile defense which includes [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] interceptors and [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot|alias_match_single_candidate]] interceptors, along with [[$1.5 billion|MONEY]] for [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense|Ground-based Midcourse Defense|annotation]] ([[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense|GMD|alias_match_single_candidate]]) against intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In [[June 2009|DATE]], the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]] deployed a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] unit to [[Hawaii|Hawaii|LOCATION_popular_entity]], along with the SBX sea-based radar, to defend against a possible North [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_single_candidate]] launch targeting [[Hawaii|the archipelago|non_person_coref]].

[[United Arab Emirates|The United Arab Emirates|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] ([[United Arab Emirates|UAE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) graduated its [[first|ORDINAL]] [[two|NUMBER]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] unit classes at [[Fort Bliss|Fort Bliss|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[2015|DATE]] and [[2016|DATE]].

In [[March 2019|DATE]], [[Bravo Battery|ORGANIZATION]], [[2nd ADA|ORGANIZATION]] Regiment (B-2 [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]]), [[11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade|ORGANIZATION]] was deployed at [[Nevatim Airbase|ORGANIZATION]] during a joint [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-[[Israel|Israeli|alias_match_single_candidate]] drill, after which it was to be moved to an undisclosed location in the [[Negev|Negev|annotation]] desert in southern [[Israel|Israel|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The [[X band|X-Band|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] radar system, which is part of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system, has been deployed at Nevatim since [[2008|DATE]].

In [[2019|DATE]], while the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System|Aegis|alias_match_single_candidate]] Ashore at [[NSF Deveselu|ORGANIZATION]] is being upgraded, B Battery, [[62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|ORGANIZATION]] (B-62 [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]]), has emplaced in [[NSF Deveselu|LOCATION]], [[Romania|Romania|alias_match_match_candidate]] during the interim.

On [[1 November 2015|DATE]], a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system was a key component of "Campaign Fierce Sentry" Flight Test Operational-02 Event [[2|NUMBER]] (FTO-02 E2), a complex [[$230 million|MONEY]] missile defense system test event conducted at [[Wake Island|Wake Island|annotation]] and the surrounding ocean areas.

The objective was to test the ability of the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System|Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense|annotation]] and [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] Weapon Systems to defeat a raid of [[three|NUMBER]] near-simultaneous air and missile targets, consisting of [[one|NUMBER]] medium-range ballistic missile, [[one|NUMBER]] short-range ballistic missile and [[one|NUMBER]] cruise missile target.

During the test, a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system on [[Wake Island|Wake Island|alias_match_match_candidate]] detected and destroyed a short-range target simulating a short-range ballistic missile that was launched by parachute ejected from a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 transport plane|annotation]].

At the same time, the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system and the [[USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53)|USS "John Paul Jones"|annotation]] guided missile destroyer both launched missiles to intercept a medium-range ballistic missile, launched by parachute from [[a second|DURATION]] [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17|alias_match_single_candidate]].

On [[17 October 2013|DATE]], the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean military|annotation]] asked the [[Pentagon|ORGANIZATION]] to provide information on the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system concerning prices and capabilities as part of efforts to strengthen defenses against North [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|Korean|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] ballistic missiles.

However, [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] Park Geun-hye administration decided it will develop its own indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile instead of buying the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] Defense Ministry officials [[previously|DATE]] requested information on the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]], as well as other missile interceptors like the [[Israel|Israeli|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Arrow 3|Arrow 3|annotation]], with the intention of researching systems for domestic technology development rather than for purchase.

Officials did however state that [[United States Army|American|alias_match_single_candidate]] deployment of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system would help in countering North [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|Korean|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] missile threats.

Later [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]] announced it would be deploying [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] by [[the end of 2017|DATE]].

In [[May 2014|DATE]], the [[Pentagon|ORGANIZATION]] revealed it was studying sites to base [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] batteries in [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In [[February 2016|DATE]], Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi|annotation]] expressed concerns that deployment of [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]], despite being directed at North [[Korea|Korea|alias_match_popular_entity]], could jeopardize [[China|China|LOCATION_popular_entity]]'s "legitimate national security interests" and in [[2017|DATE]] the Vice Chairman of [[China|China|LOCATION_popular_entity]]'s Central [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|Military|alias_match_single_candidate]] Commission asserted to the Chairman of the [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Joint Chiefs of Staff that deployment of [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] around [[China|China|LOCATION_popular_entity]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of the factors which had a negative influence on "bilateral military ties and mutual trust."

The major controversy among Chinese officials is that they believe the purpose of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system, "which detects and intercepts incoming missiles at high altitudes, is actually to track missiles launched from [[China|China|LOCATION_popular_entity]]" not from North [[Korea|Korea|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Chinese experts report that [[China|China|LOCATION_popular_entity]] is focused on the positioning of another [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar system, this [[one|NUMBER]] on the [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] peninsula, for gleaning details about [[China|China|LOCATION_popular_entity]]'s nuclear weapons delivery systems, such as [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]]'s ability to distinguish which missiles might be carrying decoy warheads.

In [[July 2016|DATE]], [[United States Army|American|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean military|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] officials agreed to deploy the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] missile defense system in [[Korea|the country|non_person_coref]] to counter North [[Korea|Korea|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s growing threats and use of ballistic missile and nuclear tests; each [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] unit consists of [[six|NUMBER]] truck-mounted launchers, [[48|NUMBER]] interceptors, a fire control and communications unit, and an [[TPY-2|AN/TPY-2|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] radar.

Seongju County in [[North Gyeongsang Province|North Gyeongsang Province|annotation]] was chosen as a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] site, partly because it is out of range of [[North Gyeongsang Province|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] rocket artillery along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ|annotation]].

On [[30 September 2016|DATE]], the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] and [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]] announced that [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] would be relocated to [[Lotte Corporation|Lotte|annotation]] Skyhill Seongju Country Club, farther from [[Andover, Massachusetts|the town|non_person_coref]]'s main residential areas and higher in elevation, to alleviate concerns.

On [[6 March 2017|DATE]], [[two|NUMBER]] [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] launcher trucks arrived by air transport at [[Osan Air Base|Osan Air Base|annotation]] [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]], for a deployment.

A [[Reuters|Reuters|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] article stated that with the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] defense system, a [[North Gyeongsang Province|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] missile barrage would still pose a threat to [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]], while an article in the [[International Journal of Space Politics & Policy|ORGANIZATION]] said that [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean forces|alias_match_single_candidate]] already possess [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot|alias_match_single_candidate]] systems for point defense and [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System|Aegis|alias_match_single_candidate]] destroyers capable of stopping ballistic missiles that may come from the north, in a three-layer antimissile defense for [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

On [[16 March 2017|DATE]], a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar arrived in [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system is kept at [[Osan Air Base|Osan Air Base|alias_match_match_candidate]] until the site where [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|the system|non_person_coref]] is due to be deployed is prepared, with an expected ready date of [[June 2017|DATE]].

By [[25 April 2017|DATE]], [[six|NUMBER]] trailers carrying the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar, interceptor launchers, communications, and support equipment entered the Seongju site.

On [[30 April 2017|DATE]], it was reported that [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]] would bear the cost of the land and facilities for [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]], while the [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]] will pay for operating it.

On [[2 May 2017|DATE]], [[Moon Sang-gyun|PERSON]], with the [[South Korea|South Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Defense Ministry and Col. [[Robert Manning III|PERSON]], a spokesman for the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military|alias_match_popular_redirect]] announced that the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system in [[Seongju|LOCATION]] is operational and "has the ability to intercept [[North Gyeongsang Province|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] missiles and defend [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]]."

It was reported that [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|the system|non_person_coref]] will not reach its full operational potential until [[later this year|DATE]] when additional elements of [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|the system|non_person_coref]] are onsite.

On [[7 June 2017|DATE]] President [[Moon Jae-in|Moon Jae-in|annotation]] suspended further [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] deployment pending a review, after discovering [[four|NUMBER]] addition launchers had entered [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]] without the defense ministry informing [[Moon Jae-in|him|PERSON_coref]].

The [[35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade|ORGANIZATION]] ([[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]]) has integrated [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] into its layered defense on the [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Peninsula, [[denoted Combined Task Force Defender|ORGANIZATION]], composed of both [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]] and [[South Korea|ROK|alias_match_single_candidate]] personnel.

Even in the face of a [[North Gyeongsang Province|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[South Korea|Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] ICBM test on [[4 July 2017|DATE]], which newly threatens [[Alaska|Alaska|LOCATION_popular_entity]], a [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak, Alaska|annotation]]-based [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] interceptor test (FTT-18) against a simulated attack by an [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile|Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] had long been planned.

FTT-18 was successfully completed by Battery A-2 [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] (Battery A, [[2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|ORGANIZATION]], [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|alias_match_article_entity]]) of the [[11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade|ORGANIZATION]] ([[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]]) on [[11 July 2017|DATE]].

Also in [[2017|DATE]] another [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak|alias_match_single_candidate]] launch of a [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] interceptor was scheduled between [[7:30PM|TIME]] and [[1:30AM|ORGANIZATION]] [[on|TIME]] [[Saturday|DATE]] [[29 July, Sunday|DATE]] [[30 July|DATE]], or [[Monday 31 July|DATE]], at alternative times, in preparation for a possible ICBM test by [[North Korea|North Korea|alias_match_popular_entity]].

In response, [[Moon Jae-in|President Moon Jae-in|alias_match_single_candidate]] called for deployment of the [[four|NUMBER]] remaining [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] launchers which were put on hold when [[Moon Jae-in|he|PERSON_coref]] came to power.

Lee Jong-kul, of [[South Korea|South Korean|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Moon Jae-in|President Moon Jae-in|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party of Korea|annotation]] states "The nuclear and missile capabilities of [[North Korea|North Korea|alias_match_popular_entity]]…have been upgraded to pose serious threats; the international cooperation system to keep the [[North Gyeongsang Province|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] in check has been nullified...", citing tensions over the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] deployment of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|alias_match_article_entity]] anti-missile system in [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

On [[30 July 2017|DATE]], a [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak|alias_match_single_candidate]]-sited [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] interceptor shot down an MRBM which launched over the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Ocean|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the [[15th|ORDINAL]] successful test; the [[Missile Defense Agency|Missile Defense Agency|annotation]] ([[Missile Defense Agency|MDA|alias_match_single_candidate]]) director emphasized the data collection from the intercept, which enhances the modelling and scenario simulation capabilities of the [[Missile Defense Agency|MDA|alias_match_single_candidate]].

These options for [[MIM-104 Patriot|the missile|non_person_coref]] defense of [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]] include "sea-based, Patriots and [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]]" according to General [[John E. Hyten|PERSON]], commander of [[United States Strategic Command|U.S. Strategic Command|annotation]].

By creating a thermonuclear-capable payload for at least [[one|NUMBER]] of its missiles, the [[North Gyeongsang Province|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] has created a need for [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]], which is capable of intercepting ICBM threats at the lower altitudes and ranges estimated for a Hwasong-14 ICBM subjected to the load of a heavier warhead needed to carry a thermonuclear weapon.

On [[25 October 2017|DATE]], Battery D, [[2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|ORGANIZATION]], [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|alias_match_article_entity]], reflagged with the [[35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade|ORGANIZATION]] in preparation for a permanent change of station to [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In the interim before [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] D-2's permanent transfer to [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]] with their families, [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] Battery A-4 will deploy to [[South Korea|South Korea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Some critics have indicated that the rollout of [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] along the former [[Iron Curtain|Iron Curtain|annotation]] and around [[China|China|annotation]] is not consistent with the stated goals of the rollout.

In [[South Korea|South Korea|annotation]] there have been public protests against the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] system

A [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong|annotation]]–based media report has claimed that [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] could be deployed in [[Taiwan|Taiwan|annotation]] to intercept [[China|People's Republic of China|annotation]] missiles.

Local military experts have said that it was neither necessary, nor affordable for [[Taiwan|Taiwan|alias_match_match_candidate]] to deploy [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] because [[China|China|alias_match_match_candidate]] is threatening [[Taiwan|Taiwan|alias_match_match_candidate]] with short-range missiles, whereas [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] is designed to shoot down medium and long-range missiles.

[[Taiwan|Taiwan|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s tracking data from its early warning system, built by the manufacturer of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] radar, can serve to counter [[China|China|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s missile launches.

In response, a retired [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] general [[Wang Hongguang|PERSON]] warned that if [[Taiwan|Taiwan|alias_match_match_candidate]] were to start deploying [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD|alias_match_article_entity]] systems then the [[People's Liberation Army|People's Liberation Army|annotation]] would start the process to conquer [[Taiwan|Taiwan|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Chiungtze C. Tsen

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Chiungtze C. Tsen|annotation]] (, [[April 2, 1898|DATE]] – [[October 1, 1940|DATE]]), given name [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Chiung|annotation]], was a [[China|Chinese|annotation]] mathematician born in [[Nanchang|Nanchang, Jiangxi|annotation]].

In that area [[he|PERSON]] proved a fundamental result which is [[now|DATE]] called [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s theorem.

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in a poor fisherman's family in [[Xinjian District|Xinjian Country|annotation]], [[Nanchang|Nanchang|annotation]], [[Jiangxi|Jiangxi|annotation]] Province.

[[His|PERSON]] father Tschu-Wun [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[曾祖文|NUMBER]]) had [[two|NUMBER]] sons and several daughters, and [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] was the eldest son.

[[His|His|PERSON_coref]] uncle Lei Heng ([[雷恒|NUMBER]]), who was a "jinshi" and a member of the [[Hanlin Academy|Hanlin Academy|annotation]], persuaded [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s father to send [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] to school.

Due to poverty, [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] had to take leaves from school intermittently to work.

After graduation in [[1920|DATE]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] taught in primary school for [[two years|DURATION]].

In [[1922|DATE]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] entered National Wuchang Senior Normal College, later National Wuchang [[University of Göttingen|University|alias_match_single_candidate]], to study undergraduate mathematics, and [[Tsebu S. Lee|he|PERSON_coref]] graduated in [[1926|DATE]].

In [[1927|DATE]], when [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang|annotation]] split with the [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party|annotation]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] and some teachers and students protested against the breakup and called for alliance.

Several of them including [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] were beaten up and were sent to hospital.

In [[1928|DATE]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] passed the [[Jiangxi|Jiangxi|alias_match_match_candidate]] provincial government scholarship examination for studying in [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] received [[Guo Moruo|his|PERSON_coref]] doctoral degree in [[February 1934|DATE]] under the supervision of [[Emmy Noether|Emmy Noether|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Friedrich Karl Schmidt|PERSON]], and [[Friedrich Karl Schmidt|he|PERSON_coref]] dedicated [[Friedrich Karl Schmidt|his|PERSON_coref]] dissertation to [[Friedrich Karl Schmidt|his|PERSON_coref]] elder cousin [[Tsebu S. Lee|PERSON]].

As a research fellow sponsored by the [[China|China|alias_match_match_candidate]] Foundation for the [[Promotion of Education and Culture|ORGANIZATION]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] did a postdoctoral research with [[Emil Artin|Emil Artin|annotation]] at [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg University|annotation]] for [[a year|DURATION]].

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to [[China|China|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[July 1935|DATE]] and was invited by [[Chen Jiangong|Chen Jiangong|annotation]] to [[Zhejiang University|National Chekiang University|annotation]] in [[Hangzhou|Hangzhou|annotation]] as professor in the area of algebra.

Chen was [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s teacher at [[Wuchang Senior Normal College|ORGANIZATION]] and had encouraged [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] to study in [[Germany|Germany|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] taught a course on algebra and a course on group theory based on the German textbooks of van [[der Waerden|ORGANIZATION]] and [[Andreas Speiser|Andreas Speiser|annotation]] respectively.

In [[1936|DATE]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] published [[Andreas Speiser|his|PERSON_coref]] [[third|ORDINAL]] paper in the journal of the new [[Chinese Mathematical Society|Chinese Mathematical Society|annotation]].

[[Ernst Witt|Ernst Witt|annotation]], who was [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s friend and had also been a student of [[Emmy Noether|Noether|alias_match_single_candidate]], always talked about [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s results in [[Ernst Witt|his|PERSON_coref]] algebra lectures and would correct others if they attributed them to [[Serge Lang|Lang|alias_match_single_candidate]] but not [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]], thus helped bring attention to this paper.

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Chen Jiangong|Chen|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] fell out because of a failed matching of [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Chen Jiangong|Chen|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s younger sister for marriage.

In [[1937|DATE]], [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] left Chekiang [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and was invited by [[Peiyang University|National Beiyang Institute of Technology|annotation]] to become a professor.

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] went to [[Xi'an|Xi'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] to take up [[Chen Jiangong|his|PERSON_coref]] post.

[[University of Hamburg|the university|non_person_coref]] soon split into several schools, [[one|NUMBER]] of which was [[Northwestern Polytechnical University|National Northwestern Institute of Technology|annotation]], and [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] became a professor of this school.

In [[1939|DATE]], [[Shu-tien Li|Shu-tien Li|annotation]], former president of [[Beiyang Institute of Technology|ORGANIZATION]] and the president of the newly-founded [[National Xikang Institute of Technology|ORGANIZATION]], invited [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] to be a professor at the new school.

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] had a chronic stomach problem, and [[Chen Jiangong|his|PERSON_coref]] condition was made worse by poor living condition and shortage of medical supplies in time of war.

[[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Tsen|alias_match_article_entity]] died of a stomach ulcer in [[Xichang|Xichang|annotation]], [[Xikang|Xikang|annotation]] on [[October 1, 1940|DATE]], and the school held a memorial service for [[Chen Jiangong|him|PERSON_coref]] on [[November 18, 1940|DATE]].

Kas Kastner

[[Kas Kastner|Robert W. Kastner|annotation]], commonly known as [[Kas Kastner|R.W. Kastner|annotation]] or [[Kas Kastner|Kas Kastner|annotation]], was born in [[Batavia, New York|Batavia, New York|annotation]].

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] has been called [[one|NUMBER]] of the most influential Americans in the history of [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] cars.

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] coined the maxim "Never be beaten by equipment."

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was born in [[Batavia, New York|Batavia, New York|annotation]].

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] graduated High School in [[1945|DATE]], then enlisted in the [[United States Army|US Army|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] for a [[two-year|DURATION]] stint, during which [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] was stationed at [[Fort Carlson|LOCATION]] in [[Colorado|Colorado|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

After [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] discharge [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] returned to [[Batavia, New York|Batavia|alias_match_single_candidate]] briefly, where [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] taught himself to drive in a [[1934|DATE]] [[Plymouth|Plymouth|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] soon returned to [[Colorado|Colorado|LOCATION_popular_entity]] where [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] earned a living in a variety of jobs, including managing the pool-hall portion of a large bar, where [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] earned some extra money hustling pool.

[[Kas Kastner|His|PERSON_coref]] next stop was working as a mechanic at a Chevrolet dealership in [[Delta, Colorado|Delta, Colorado|annotation]].

In [[1951|DATE]] [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] bought [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] sports car, a Crosley Super Sport, on the basis of a road test by [[Tom McCahill|Tom McCahill|annotation]] in "[[Mechanix Illustrated|Mechanix Illustrated|annotation]]".

Seeing [[Ken Miles|Ken Miles|annotation]] race [[Ken Miles|his|PERSON_coref]] R1 MG Special at [[Pebble Beach, California|Pebble Beach|annotation]] in [[1953|DATE]] inspired [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] to build [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] own special.

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] built [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] car with an engine and chassis from an MG and bodywork of [[0.019|NUMBER]] in thick aluminum paneling that was screwed in place to a framework made of welded electrical conduit.

[[Kas Kastner|His|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] race was on the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen, Colorado|annotation]], where [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] placed [[second|ORDINAL]] and won [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] class.

From there [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] went on to compete in several hill climbs and other events.

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] raced a [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[1954|DATE]] at [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs, Colorado|annotation]].

In [[1956|DATE]] Kastner moved with [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] wife and [[two|NUMBER]] children to [[California|California|LOCATION_popular_entity]], where [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] went to work for [[Williamson Motors|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles|LOCATION_popular_entity]] as a mechanic.

While still racing [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] MG-powered Special, [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] went to work for [[Cal Sales|ORGANIZATION]], the [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] distributor for the [[Western United States|Western United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]], in [[Gardena, California|Gardenia, California|annotation]] as a mechanic.

By [[June 1958|DATE]] [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] had risen to the position of service and parts supervisor, where [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] managed a staff of [[70|NUMBER]].

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] also served as chief instructor for the [[California Sports Car Club|ORGANIZATION]] at [[Riverside Raceway|LOCATION]] and as the [[National Licensing|ORGANIZATION]] Chairman for the [[SCCA|ORGANIZATION]], as well as winning the [[SCCA|ORGANIZATION]]'s annual award for Best Technical Article ([[1963|DATE]]).

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] used well-known methods like porting and polishing ports and milling the heads to increase the compression ratio to as much as [[12.6:1|NUMBER]].

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Dean Moon|Dean Moon|annotation]] collaborated to develop a camshaft profile able to provide [[150|NUMBER]] hp with the factory [[SU carburettor|SU|annotation]] carbs.

When the [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] factory questioned [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s claimed outputs, [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] shipped an engine to [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]], where it developed [[152|NUMBER]] hp on [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s own dynamometer.

Company policy barred any company executive from racing, including [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]].

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] stopped racing, but continued building performance parts in [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] own garage, which [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] then sold to [[Cal|LOCATION]] Sales.

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] began to write manuals on how to tune and prepare [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] cars for racing.

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] also instituted a driver assistance program, providing financial support for successful club racers.

When [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] asked to be compensated for the work [[Kas Kastner|he|PERSON_coref]] did preparing the Sebring cars, the president of [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] refused.

[[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] countered [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby|alias_match_single_candidate]] by offering to match the salary if [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] would stay to establish and run a new US competition department.

[[Bob Tullius|Bob Tullius|annotation]] was [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] principal driver.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s next project was preparing [[three|NUMBER]] TR4s for the [[1964|DATE]] [[Shell 4000 Rally|ORGANIZATION]] from [[Vancouver|Vancouver|LOCATION_popular_entity]] to [[Montreal|Montreal|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

ifornia|LOCATION_popular_entity]], where [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] substituted a [[200|NUMBER]] hp [[2|NUMBER]] L inline [[six|NUMBER]] and a TR4 transmission, added a larger radiator and fuel tank and modified the hood with a scoop to clear the longer engine. After racing the car briefly it was sold.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] sent [[four|NUMBER]] TR4As to Sebring again in [[1966|DATE]], where they placed [[first|ORDINAL]], [[second|ORDINAL]] [[and third|ORDINAL]] in the [[2.5|NUMBER]] GT class.

[[The year|DATE]] after the team's 1-2-3 finish at Sebring, [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] took a specially prepared TR4A to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats|Bonneville Salt Flats|annotation]].

Reportedly all [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] took with [[Kas Kastner|him|PERSON_coref]] was [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] reputation, a promise of a magazine cover page, and a single rough drawing done by [[Pete Brock|Pete Brock|annotation]], designer of the [[Shelby Daytona|Shelby Daytona|annotation]] coupe.

Kastner and [[Pete Brock|Brock|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had been talking about this project for [[several years|DURATION]] prior to [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s trip to [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] also mentioned the [[Rover V8 engine|Rover V8|annotation]] engine as a possible [[future|DATE]] power-plant.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] left [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[1970|DATE]].

Following [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] departure from [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] formed [[Kastner-Brophy Inc.|ORGANIZATION]], and [[Kastner Brophy Racing|ORGANIZATION]] with [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles|LOCATION_popular_entity]] advertising executive and media personality [[John Brophy|John Brophy|PERSON_human_disambiguation]].

Nicknamed the "Candybox" by [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s then-girlfriend for its bright, garish paint scheme, [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] added [[Carillo|PERSON]] rods, a lightened crankshaft, a [[Cline|PERSON]] head and [[Weber|PERSON]] carburetors to the [[2.0|NUMBER]] L straight-six engine.

[[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] stopped production of the [[Triumph Vitesse|Vitesse|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[1971|DATE]], and [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] sold [[Triumph Vitesse|the car|non_person_coref]] in [[1973|DATE]].

With sponsorship from [[Carling Black Label|ORGANIZATION]] beer, [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] led [[Lola Cars|the team|non_person_coref]]'s efforts in Can-Am, Formula [[5000|NUMBER]] as well as [[three|NUMBER]] Indy [[500|NUMBER]] races.

Around this time [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] took up sailboat racing, winning a National Championship title for 13-foot Cyclone boats and another in the 30-foot keel boats class, in addition to several [[Fleet and District Championships|ORGANIZATION]].

Attempts to turn [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] interest in sailing into viable businesses were unsuccessful.

Discussions with friend and early turbocharging expert [[Hugh MacInnes|PERSON]] led [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] to establish [[Arkay Incorporated|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Hawthorne California|LOCATION]].

[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby|alias_match_single_candidate]] employee [[Ray Geddes|PERSON]] saw [[AC 3000ME|the car|non_person_coref]] in [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s shop and got [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby|alias_match_single_candidate]] involved.

At the [[time|DATE]] [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby|alias_match_single_candidate]] was working with [[Chrysler|Chrysler|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]], for whom [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had already done a turbocharged [[2.2|NUMBER]] L engine.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] hired Ashley Page as team manager and [[Trevor Harris|PERSON]] as team engineer.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Kas Kastner|his|PERSON_coref]] new GTP staff started making changes.

At [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s direction Electramotive was bought outright by [[Nissan|Nissan|alias_match_match_candidate]], and a new group, [[Nissan|Nissan|alias_match_match_candidate]] Performance Technology Incorporated ([[Nissan|NPTI|acronym]]), was established in Vista California with [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] as Vice President of Operations.

At [[NPTI Kastner|PERSON]] had a team of over [[225|NUMBER]] working for [[Kas Kastner|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Lola Cars|the team|non_person_coref]] was disbanded, and [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] formally retired from racing.

During [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s tenure the [[Nissan|Team Nissan|alias_match_single_candidate]] GTP car won the drivers championship [[four years|DURATION]] in a row, and the Manufacturers Championship [[three years|DURATION]] in a row.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] wife died in [[1997|DATE]].

[[Kas Kastner|He|PERSON_coref]] married long-time friend [[Peggy DeMerritt|PERSON]] in [[November 2000|DATE]].

It was [[Peggy|PERSON]] that encouraged [[Kas Kastner|him|PERSON_coref]] to get involved in vintage racing.

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] has since served as grand marshal at several vintage racing events, including the [[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] Cup, which is awarded to [[one|NUMBER]] [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph|alias_match_single_candidate]] competitor [[each year|SET]].

[[Kas Kastner|Kastner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was inducted into the British Sports Car [[Hall|PERSON]] of Fame in [[2017|DATE]].

The name [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] derives from the [[Irish language|Irish|annotation]] '[[Iar|ORGANIZATION]] Ros' meaning 'western promontory'.

The full name is the [[Erris|Iorrais|alias_match_article_entity]] Domnann, after the [[Fir Bolg|Fir Bolg|annotation]] tribe, the [[Fir Domnann|ORGANIZATION]].

There are [[five|NUMBER]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic|annotation]] parishes in [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]]: [[Kilcommon (County Mayo civil parish)|Kilcommon|annotation]], [[Mullet Peninsula|Kilmore|annotation]], [[Kiltane|Kiltane|annotation]], [[Belmullet|Belmullet|annotation]] and Ballycroy.

Parts of [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] are in a [[Gaeltacht|Gaeltacht|annotation]] area, with first-language speakers of [[Irish language|Irish|annotation]] in the following areas of the barony: An [[Fál Mór|PERSON]], Tamhaiin na hUltaí, [[Glais|PERSON]], [[Eachléim|LOCATION]], [[Tearmann|LOCATION]], [[Tránn|LOCATION]], An [[Mullach Rua|ORGANIZATION]], [[Cartúr|LOCATION]], An Baile Úr, [[Cill Ghallagáin|PERSON]], [[Corrán Buí|PERSON]], Ceathrú na gCloch, Port a' Chluaidh, [[Ros Dumhach|PERSON]] and [[Carrowteige|Ceathrú Thaidhg|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

There are between [[3,500-5,000|NUMBER]] native [[Irish language|Irish speakers|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]].

Much of inland [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] is covered with blanket bog.

[[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] has a large range of habitats including blanket bogs, estuaries, salt marshes, fresh water lakes, coasts, cliffs, machair, sand dunes, sandy beaches and rocky shores.

The oldest rocks in [[Ireland|Ireland|annotation]], some [[1.8 billion years old|DURATION]], are to be found on the west coasts of [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]], in common with most of inland [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_match_candidate]], became covered in extensive native woodland a few [[thousand years|DURATION]] after the last Ice Age retreated (approx [[15,000 years ago|DATE]]) but its northern and western shores remained relatively lightly afforested.

Across inland [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]], the remains of these forests can be seen

During the [[Neolithic|Neolithic|annotation]] period, starting [[about 6,000 years ago|DATE]], the [[first|ORDINAL]] people living in [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_match_candidate]] whose ancestors had hunted and gathered along the coastlines of [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] from [[about 9,000 years ago|DATE]], began to cut down the forestry to clear land for growing crops and grazing livestock.

[[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell|annotation]]'s policy ([[mid 17th century|DATE]]) of sending the native [[Ireland|Irish|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] who refused to bow down to [[Oliver Cromwell|him|PERSON_coref]] "to hell or to Connaught" saw a large influx of population into [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] where the disinherited native [[Ireland|Irish|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] tried to eke a living from very poor quality agricultural land under the tenancy of the landlords and their agents.

During the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine|annotation]] of [[1845|DATE]] - [['47|DATE]] many died in [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] despite the close proximity of the sea, because they could not raise the cash to fund a passage to [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]].

Some [[19th|ORDINAL]]- and early 20th-century antiquarians and surveyors visited the [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] area and wrote about their experiences and thoughts on the area at that time.

These include works by [[William Bald|Patrick Knight|annotation]] ("[[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] in the [[Ireland|Irish|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Highlands"), [[Caesar Otway|Caesar Otway|annotation]] ("Sketches in [[Erris|Erris|alias_match_article_entity]] and Tyrawley") and [[Thomas Johnson Westropp|Thomas Johnson Westropp|annotation]] ("The Promontory Forts and [[Bronze Age|Early|alias_match_single_candidate]] Remains of the Coast of [[County Mayo|Mayo|alias_match_single_candidate]]").

[[Kaoru Moto|He|PERSON_coref]] is a "[[Nisei|Nisei|annotation]]", which means that [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] is [[a second|DURATION]] generation [[Nisei|Japanese-American|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Ten months|DURATION]] before the [[Japan|Japanese|alias_match_single_candidate]] attack on [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] joined the [[United States Army|US Army|annotation]] in [[March 1941|DATE]].

On [[July 7, 1944|DATE]], [[Kaoru Moto|Moto|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was serving as a private first class in the [[100th|ORDINAL]] Infantry Battalion.

On that [[day|DURATION]], near [[Castellina Marittima|PERSON]], [[Italy|Italy|annotation]], [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] single-handedly silenced [[two|NUMBER]] enemy machine gun positions while acting as a scout, and then destroyed a [[third|ORDINAL]] despite being seriously wounded.

[[United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II|Private First Class|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Kaoru Moto|Kaoru Moto|alias_match_article_entity]] distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on [[7 July 1944|DATE]], near [[Castellina|Castellina|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]], [[Italy|Italy|alias_match_match_candidate]].

While serving as [[first|ORDINAL]] scout, [[United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II|Private First Class|alias_match_single_candidate]] Moto observed a machine gun nest that was hindering [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] platoon's progress.

On [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] own initiative, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] made [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] way to a point [[ten|NUMBER]] paces from the hostile position, and killed the enemy machine gunner.

Taking [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] prisoner with [[Kaoru Moto|him|PERSON_coref]], [[United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II|Private First Class|alias_match_single_candidate]] Moto took a position a few yards from a house to prevent the enemy from using the building as an observation post.

While guarding [[White House|the house|non_person_coref]] and [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] prisoner, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] observed an enemy machine gun team moving into position.

[[Kaoru Moto|He|PERSON_coref]] engaged them, and with deadly fire forced the enemy to withdraw.

An enemy sniper located in another house fired at [[United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II|Private First Class|alias_match_single_candidate]] Moto, severely wounding [[Kaoru Moto|him|PERSON_coref]].

Applying [[first|ORDINAL]] aid to [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] wound, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] changed position to elude the sniper fire and to advance.

Finally relieved of [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] position, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] made [[Kaoru Moto|his|PERSON_coref]] way to the rear for treatment.

Crossing a road, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] spotted an enemy machine gun nest.

Opening fire, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] wounded [[two|NUMBER]] of the [[three|NUMBER]] soldiers occupying the position.

Not satisfied with this accomplishment, [[Kaoru Moto|he|PERSON_coref]] then crawled forward to a better position and ordered the enemy soldier to surrender.

Chepstow

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|annotation]] ([[Chepstow|Cas-gwent|alias_match_article_entity]]) is a town and community in [[Monmouthshire|Monmouthshire|annotation]], [[Wales|Wales|LOCATION_popular_entity]], adjoining the border with [[Gloucestershire|Gloucestershire|annotation]], [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The port of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] became noted in the [[Middle Ages|Middle Ages|annotation]] for its imports of wine, and also became a major centre for the export of timber and bark, from nearby woodland in the [[Wye Valley|Wye valley|annotation]] and [[Forest of Dean|Forest of Dean|annotation]].

In [[the late eighteenth century|DATE]] [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] was a focus of early tourism as part of the "[[Wye Tour|Wye Tour|annotation]]", and the tourist industry remains important.

Other important industries included shipbuilding – [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[World War I|First World War|annotation]] [[National Shipyard|National Shipyard|annotation]]s was established in [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] – and heavy engineering, including the prefabrication of bridges and wind turbine towers.

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] is also well known for its racecourse, which has hosted the [[Welsh Grand National|Welsh National|annotation]] [[each year since|SET]] [[1949|DATE]].

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] had a population of [[10,821|NUMBER]] according to the [[2001|DATE]] census, increasing to [[12,350|NUMBER]] at the [[2011|DATE]] census.

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] is on the western bank of the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], while adjoining villages on the eastern bank of [[River Severn|the river|non_person_coref]], [[Tutshill|Tutshill|annotation]] and [[Sedbury|Sedbury|annotation]], are located in [[England|England|alias_match_popular_entity]].

The modern [[Welsh language|Welsh|alias_match_single_candidate]] name "[[Chepstow|Cas-gwent|alias_match_article_entity]]" refers to the "[[Castell|PERSON]] (castle) of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent|annotation]]".

The name [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent|alias_match_single_candidate]] itself derives from the Roman settlement "[[Venta Silurum|Venta Silurum|annotation]]" or 'Market of the [[Silures|Silures|annotation]]', [[now|DATE]] named [[Caerwent|Caerwent|annotation]], [[5|NUMBER]] mi west of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]], which had been the Romano-British commercial centre of south-east [[Wales|Wales|alias_match_popular_entity]].

The [[Old English|English|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] name [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] derives from the [[Old English|Old English|annotation]] "ceap/chepe stowe", meaning market place or trading centre.

The oldest site of known habitation at [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] is at [[Thornwell|LOCATION]], overlooking the estuaries of the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and [[River Severn|Severn|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] close to the modern [[M48 motorway|M48 motorway|annotation]] junction, where archaeological investigations in advance of recent housing development revealed continuous human occupation from the [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic|annotation]] period of around [[5000 BC|DATE]] until the end of the Roman period, [[about 400 AD|DATE]].

. [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] is located at a crossing point directly between the Roman towns at [[Gloucester|Gloucester|annotation]] ("[[Glevum|Glevum|annotation]]") and [[Caerwent|Caerwent|annotation]] ("[[Venta Silurum|Venta Silurum|annotation]]"). Although historians think it likely that there was a small Roman fort in [[Wye Valley|the area|non_person_coref]], the only evidence found so far has been of Roman material and burials, rather than buildings.

After the Romans left, [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] was within the southern part of the [[Welsh language|Welsh|alias_match_single_candidate]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent|alias_match_single_candidate]], known as "[[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent|alias_match_single_candidate]] Is-coed" (ie.

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] is close to the southern point of [[Offa's Dyke|Offa's Dyke|annotation]], which begins on the east bank of the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] at [[Sedbury|Sedbury|annotation]] and runs all the way to the [[Irish Sea|Irish Sea|annotation]] in north [[Wales|Wales|alias_match_popular_entity]].

This was built in [[the late 8th century|DATE]] as a boundary between [[Mercia|Mercia|annotation]] and the [[Welsh language|Welsh|alias_match_single_candidate]] kingdoms, although some recent research has questioned whether the stretch near [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] formed part of the original Dyke.

It is possible, though not clearly substantiated, that [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] may have superseded [[Caerwent|Caerwent|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a trading centre, and been used by both Saxons and the [[Welsh language|Welsh|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The [[Lancaut|Lancaut|annotation]] and [[Beachley|Beachley|annotation]] peninsulas, opposite [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]], were in [[Welsh language|Welsh|alias_match_single_candidate]] rather than [[Mercia|Mercia|annotation]]n control at that time, although by the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Book|annotation]] [[Striguil|Striguil|alias_match_match_candidate]] was assessed as part of [[Gloucestershire|Gloucestershire|alias_match_match_candidate]].

After the [[Norman Conquest|Norman conquest of England|annotation]], [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] was a key location.

Bigod was also responsible for establishing a weekly market and annual fair, in [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] which had grown up on the slopes between the castle and priory, and for building the [[Chepstow Port Wall|Port Wall|annotation]] around it shortly after [[1274|DATE]].

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] faced some hostile attacks from the [[Welsh people|Welsh|annotation]] to the west, but after [[the 14th century|DATE]] the castle's importance diminished.

The port of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] developed during the mediaeval period, [[one|NUMBER]] reason being that its control by a [[Marcher Lord|Marcher Lord|annotation]], rather than by the [[Kingdom of England|King|annotation]], meant that it was exempt from [[Kingdom of England|English|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] taxation.

From mediaeval times, [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] was the largest port in [[Wales|Wales|alias_match_popular_entity]]; its ships sailed as far as [[Iceland|Iceland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[Turkey|Turkey|LOCATION_popular_entity]], as well as to [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[Portugal|Portugal|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] was known for its imports of wine.

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] was given its [[first|ORDINAL]] charter in [[1524|DATE]], and became part of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire|annotation]] when [[Monmouthshire (historic)|the county|non_person_coref]] was formed.

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] appears as "Strigulia", "[[Chepstow|Chepstowe|alias_match_article_entity]]" and "Castelh [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent|alias_match_single_candidate]]" on the [[Cambriae Typus|Cambriae Typus|annotation]] map of [[1573|DATE]].

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] reached the peak of its importance during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic Wars|annotation]], when its exports of timber, for ships, and bark, for leather tanning, were especially vital.

An important aspect of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]]'s trade was entrepôt trade: bringing larger cargoes into the manageable deep water of the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] on high tide and breaking down the load for on-shipment in the many trows up the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] to [[Hereford|Hereford|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[past|DATE]] the coin stamping mill at Redbrook, or up the [[River Severn|Severn|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to [[Gloucester|Gloucester|alias_match_match_candidate]] and beyond.

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] also traded across the estuary to [[Bristol|Bristol|alias_match_match_candidate]] on suitable tides to work vessels up and down the [[Avon|LOCATION]] to that city's centre.

Many buildings in [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] remain from the late [[18th|ORDINAL]] and [[early 19th centuries|DATE]]; the elegant cast iron bridge across the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] was opened in [[1816|DATE]] to replace an earlier wooden structure.

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] became an important centre for tourism from [[the late eighteenth century|DATE]], when the "[[Wye Tour|Wye Tour|annotation]]" became popular.

In [[1840|DATE]] leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartist|annotation]] insurrection in [[Newport, Wales|Newport|alias_match_single_candidate]] were transported from [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Van Diemen's Land|Van Diemen's Land|annotation]].

From [[1938|DATE]], [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] housed the head office of the [[Red & White Services|Red & White|annotation]] bus company, on [[Bulwark, Chepstow|Bulwark|alias_match_single_candidate]] Road.

New housing development in [[the twentieth century|DATE]] took place to the north and south of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] centre, and more [[recently|DATE]] beyond the [[A466 road|A466 road|annotation]] to the west of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]].

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] developed rapidly after the opening of the [[Severn Bridge|Severn Bridge|annotation]] in [[1966|DATE]], which replaced the car ferry between Beachley and Aust and allowed easier commuting between [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] a

[[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] is located on the west bank of the [[River Wye|River Wye|alias_match_match_candidate]], some [[3|NUMBER]] mi north of its confluence with the [[River Severn|Severn estuary|alias_match_single_candidate]].

To the north of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]], the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] passes through a limestone gorge, and there are limestone cliffs at [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] both north and south of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] centre and on the opposite (east) side of [[River Severn|the river|non_person_coref]].

[[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] is overlooked by the inland cliffs at [[Wyndcliff|Wyndcliff|annotation]] near [[St Arvans|LOCATION]], about [[2|NUMBER]] mi north of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]], and, from parts of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]], the [[River Severn|Severn estuary|alias_match_single_candidate]] and its bridges can be seen.

[[Monmouthshire (historic)|the historic|non_person_coref]] centre of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] occupies part of a bend in the [[River Wye|River Wye|alias_match_match_candidate]], and slopes up from [[River Wye|the river|non_person_coref]] to [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] centre and beyond.

The climate of [[Chepstow|the town|non_person_coref]] is affected by its position close to the [[River Severn|Severn estuary|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The bedrock of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] is limestone, mudstone and sandstone, overlain in places with some gravels and the clay and silt of [[River Severn|the river|non_person_coref]]'s tidal flats, which are of marine origin and [[up to two million years old|DURATION]].

Layered outcrops of darker [[Black Rock limestone|ORGANIZATION]], which makes up a broad part of [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]]'s bedrock, are very clear in cliffs along [[Craig Yr Afon|PERSON]], part of the [[Wales Coast Path|Wales Coast Path|annotation]] extending from [[Wyebank Road|ORGANIZATION]], and by the link road from [[Bulwark, Chepstow|Bulwark|alias_match_single_candidate]] Road to the [[M48 motorway|M48|alias_match_single_candidate]], where the looser reddish [[Mercia Mudstone Group|Mercia Mudstone|annotation]] (which extends under [[Bulwark, Chepstow|Bulwark|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Sedbury|Sedbury|alias_match_match_candidate]] and forms the cliffs at the [[River Severn|Severn|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) and the lighter [[Hunts Bay Oolite|Hunts Bay limestone|annotation]] are also seen.

[[River Wye|The River Wye|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] at [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]] has [[one|NUMBER]] of the highest tidal ranges in the world.

However, after the [[Norman Conquest|Norman conquest|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], areas east of the [[River Wye|Wye|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], within the former [[Saxons|Saxon|alias_match_popular_redirect]] royal manor of [[Tidenham|Tidenham|annotation]] and including [[Beachley|Beachley|annotation]], [[Tutshill|Tutshill|annotation]], [[Sedbury|Sedbury|annotation]] and [[Tidenham|Tidenham|alias_match_match_candidate]] Chase, were included within the lordship of [[Striguil|Striguil|annotation]] or [[Chepstow|Chepstow|alias_match_article_entity]].

France Balantič

[[France Balantič|France Balantič|annotation]] ([[29 November 1921|DATE]] – [[24 November 1943|DATE]]) was a [[Slovene language|Slovene|annotation]] poet.

[[France Balantič|His|PERSON_coref]] works were banned from schools and libraries during the [[Titoism|Titoist|annotation]] regime in [[Slovenia|Slovenia|LOCATION_popular_entity]], but since the late [[1980s|DATE]] [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] has been re-evaluated as [[one|NUMBER]] of the foremost [[Slovene language|Slovene|alias_match_single_candidate]] poets of [[the 20th century|DATE]].

Before [[World War II|World War II|annotation]], [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] studied Slavic linguistics at the [[University of Ljubljana|University of Ljubljana|annotation]].

As a devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic|annotation]], [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] was however suspicious to the materialist world view [[present|DATE]] in most left-wing ideologies of the time, especially in [[Communism|Communism|annotation]].

By [[1941|DATE]] [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] had turned away from political activism, convinced that the only salvation for humanity was to be found in the [[Gospel|Gospel|annotation]].

In [[the first months|DURATION]] after the Axis invasion of [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia|alias_match_popular_entity]] and the Italian occupation of [[Ljubljana|Ljubljana|annotation]], [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] joined the illegal student organization of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation|Liberation Front of the Slovenian People|annotation]], but left it soon afterwards, disturbed by its pro-[[Communism|Communist|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] leanings.

In [[June 1942|DATE]], the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist|annotation]] authorities of the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian|annotation]]-occupied [[Province of Ljubljana|Province of Ljubljana|annotation]] interned [[France Balantič|him|PERSON_coref]] in the [[Gonars concentration camp|Gonars concentration camp|annotation]], together with several other nationalist students, including [[Zorko Simčič|PERSON]] and [[Marjan Tršar|PERSON]].

The most typical trait of [[France Balantič|Balantič|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s poetry is [[France Balantič|his|PERSON_coref]] unique blend of personalist and eschatological visions, in which a messianic sense of the tragic dissolution of civilization and the end of time is intertwined with premonitions of [[France Balantič|his|PERSON_coref]] own death and a strong erotic feeling.

Most of [[France Balantič|his|PERSON_coref]] poems are a search towards a personal vision of Divinity, in connection with the tradition of [[Catholic Church|Catholic|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] mysticism.

[[France Balantič|He|PERSON_coref]] developed a complex metaphorical-hermetical style, verging on manierism.

In many ways, [[France Balantič|Balantič|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] continued the tradition of [[Slovene language|Slovene|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Christians|Christian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] expressionism, whose main exponents were [[Anton Vodnik|Anton Vodnik|annotation]] and [[Edvard Kocbek|Edvard Kocbek|annotation]], which, following the example of the writer [[Ivan Pregelj|PERSON]], [[Ivan Pregelj|he|PERSON_coref]] connected with elements of Baroque aestheticism.

When the literary historian [[Anton Slodnjak|PERSON]] mentioned [[France Balantič|Balantič|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] in [[France Balantič|his|PERSON_coref]] "Review of [[Slovene language|Slovene|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Literature" in [[the 1950s|DATE]], [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] was fired from [[France Balantič|his|PERSON_coref]] post at the [[University of Ljubljana|University of Ljubljana|alias_match_match_candidate]] because of it.

In [[1966|DATE]], a selection of [[France Balantič|Balantič|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s poems were printed under the title "Muževna steblika", but after intervention by the [[Communism|Communist Party|alias_match_single_candidate]] it was decided that the book should be withdrawn and the entire run was sent to be destroyed and recycled.

[[France Balantič|His|PERSON_coref]] poems were published among the [[Slovenia|Slovene|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] diaspora, especially in [[Argentina|Argentina|annotation]], where the literary historians [[Tine Debeljak|PERSON]] and [[France Papež|LOCATION]] edited and published most of [[France Balantič|his|PERSON_coref]] works.

In the [[late|DATE]] [[1980s|DATE]], [[France Balantič|Balantič|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was rediscovered in [[Slovenia|Slovenia|annotation]], and [[France Balantič|he|PERSON_coref]] is [[now|DATE]] considered [[one|NUMBER]] of the foremost [[Slovene language|Slovene-language|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] poets of [[the 20th century|DATE]], along with [[Edvard Kocbek|Edvard Kocbek|annotation]] and [[Srečko Kosovel|Srečko Kosovel|annotation]].

At the end of its run, several [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] franchises joined the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]].

During its existence, the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] was often simply referred to as "the Association" in the media, in contrast to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]], which was sometimes called "[[National League|the league|non_person_coref]]".

The [[American Association (19th century)|American Association|alias_match_article_entity]] distinguished itself in several ways from what it considered to be the puritanical [[National League|National League|annotation]].

In contrast to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]], the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] offered cheaper ticket prices, [[Sunday|DATE]] games and alcoholic beverages to its patrons.

As such, the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association|alias_match_article_entity]] was the world's [[first|ORDINAL]] professional sports league designed to out-compete another by better accommodating blue-collar tendencies and attitudes toward spectator sport.

The [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] at that time prohibited the sale of alcohol on its grounds, while the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] had no such restrictions, especially as several of its teams were backed by breweries and distilleries.

The [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] became known as "The Beer and Whiskey League", another pejorative term applied by [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] owners, and which did not seem to bother the fans of [[the Association|ORGANIZATION]]'s clubs.

[[Beginning in 1884|DATE]] and continuing through [[1890|DATE]], the champion of the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] met the champion of the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] in an early version of the [[World Series|World Series|annotation]].

The [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] won [[four|NUMBER]] of these [[World Series|Series|alias_match_single_candidate]], while the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] won only [[one|NUMBER]], in [[1886|DATE]] when the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns|annotation]] ([[now|DATE]] [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals|alias_match_single_candidate]]) defeated the [[History of the Chicago Cubs|Chicago White Stockings|annotation]] ([[now|DATE]] Cubs).

Over its lifetime, the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] was weakened by several factors.

Some owners of [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] teams also owned a [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] team.

The most significant blow to the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] was dealt by the [[Players' League|Players' League|annotation]], a [[third|ORDINAL]] major league formed in , which siphoned off talent and gate receipts.

In a rare historical oddity, the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn|LOCATION_popular_entity]] Bridegrooms ([[now|DATE]] the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles Dodgers|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]]) won [[National League|the league|non_person_coref]]'s championship and represented the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] in the [[1889|DATE]] [[World Series|World Series|alias_match_match_candidate]], switched to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] during the off-season, and then repeated the same feat.

No player who spent the majority of [[his|PERSON]] career in the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] is in the baseball Hall of Fame, although [[Bid McPhee|Bid McPhee|annotation]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Reds|annotation]] played [[eight|NUMBER]] of [[Bid McPhee|his|PERSON_coref]] [[eighteen|NUMBER]] seasons in the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] before the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds|alias_match_single_candidate]] moved to the [[National League|National League|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The living legacy of the old [[American Association (19th century)|Association|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] is the group of teams that came over to the [[National League|National League|alias_match_match_candidate]] to stay.

The Pirates moved to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] after the [[1886|DATE]] season, the Bridegrooms/Dodgers and the [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Reds|annotation]] after the [[1889|DATE]] season, and the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Browns|alias_match_single_candidate]]/[[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals|alias_match_single_candidate]] after the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association|alias_match_article_entity]] folded following the [[1891|DATE]] season.

Following the reorganization and contraction of the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] from [[12|NUMBER]] teams down to [[8|NUMBER]] in [[1900|DATE]], half of the [[eight|NUMBER]] surviving teams were former members of the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]].

Several of the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]]'s home-field venues survived into [[the 1960s|DATE]]: The ballpark used by the [[1891|DATE]] [[Griffith Stadium|Washington|LOCATION_single_candidate]] club evolved into [[Griffith Stadium|Griffith Stadium|annotation]]; the home of the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns|alias_match_popular_redirect]], [[Sportsman's Park|Sportsman's Park|annotation]]; and [[Cincinnati|the city|non_person_coref]] block occupied by the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds|alias_match_single_candidate]], which evolved into [[Crosley Field|Crosley Field|annotation]].

Crosley was the last physical remnant of the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] to go, other than the clubs themselves, when it was replaced by [[Riverfront Stadium|Riverfront Stadium|annotation]] in mid-1970.

During the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]]'s existence, several teams defected over to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]], and at the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]]'s demise in [[1891|DATE]] [[four|NUMBER]] additional clubs joined the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Four|NUMBER]] former [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] clubs, the [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh|alias_match_match_candidate]] Pirates (defected to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[1887|DATE]]), the [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Reds|alias_match_match_candidate]] (defected to the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[1889|DATE]]), the [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles|LOCATION_popular_entity]] Dodgers (defected in [[1890|DATE]]) and the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals|alias_match_match_candidate]] (joined the [[National League|NL|alias_match_single_candidate]] after the [[American Association (19th century)|AA|alias_match_article_entity]] demise in [[1891|DATE]]), have posted more than [[10,000|NUMBER]] lifetime major league victories.

On the session of the [[1st Great People|ORGANIZATION]]'s Khuraldaan of [[Mongolia|Mongolia|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[1924|DATE]], a majority of delegates expressed their wish to change [[Ulaanbaatar|the capital|non_person_coref]] city's name to "[[Baghatur|Baatar|annotation]] Khot" ("Hero City").

However, under pressure from [[Turar Ryskulov|Turar Ryskulov|annotation]], a Soviet activist of the [[Communist International|Communist International|annotation]], [[Denver|the city|non_person_coref]] was named "[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] Khot" ("City of Red Hero").

In [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[North America|North America|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] continued to be generally known as [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] or Khure until [[1924|DATE]], and afterward as [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulan Bator|alias_match_article_entity]] (a spelling derived from Улан-Батор, "[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulan-Bator|alias_match_article_entity]]").

This form was defined [[two decades|DURATION]] before the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] name got its [[current|DATE]] [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script|annotation]] spelling and "[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]]" transliteration ([[1941|DATE]]–[[1950|DATE]]); however, the name of [[Denver|the city|non_person_coref]] was spelled "[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] koto" during [[the decade|DATE]] in which Mongolia used the Latin alphabet.

Human habitation at the site of [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] dates from the [[Lower Paleolithic|Lower Paleolithic|annotation]], with a number of sites on [[Bogd Khan Mountain|Bogd Khan|annotation]], Buyant-Ukhaa and Songinokhairkhan mountains, revealing tools which date from [[300,000 years ago|DATE]] to [[40,000|NUMBER]]–[[12,000 years ago|DATE]].

These Upper Paleolithic people hunted mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, the bones of which are found abundantly around [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]].

A number of [[Xiongnu|Xiongnu|annotation]]-era royal tombs have been discovered around [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]], including the tombs of [[Belkh Gorge|ORGANIZATION]] near [[Dambadarjaalin|LOCATION]] monastery and tombs of Songinokhairkhan.

Located on the banks of the [[Tuul River|Tuul River|annotation]], [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] has been well within the sphere of Turco-[[Mongols|Mongol|alias_match_popular_redirect]] nomadic empires throughout history.

Founded in [[1639|DATE]] as a yurt monastery, [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]], originally Örgöö (palace-yurt), was [[first|ORDINAL]] located at Lake Shireet Tsagaan nuur ([[75|NUMBER]] km directly east of the imperial capital [[Karakorum|Karakorum|annotation]]) in what is [[now|DATE]] Burd sum, [[Övörkhangai|LOCATION]], around [[230|NUMBER]] km south-west from the [[present|DATE]] site of [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]], and was intended by the [[Mongols|Mongol|alias_match_popular_redirect]] nobles to be the seat of [[Zanabazar|Zanabazar|annotation]], the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu|Jebtsundamba Khutughtu|annotation]].

[[Zanabazar|Zanabazar|alias_match_match_candidate]] returned to [[Mongolia|Mongolia|alias_match_match_candidate]] from [[Tibet|Tibet|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1651|DATE]], and founded [[seven|NUMBER]] "aimags" (monastic departments) in [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]], later establishing [[four|NUMBER]] more.

[[One|NUMBER]] of the earliest Western mentions of [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] is the account of the Scottish traveller [[John Bell|John Bell|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] in [[1721|DATE]]:

"What they call the [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] is the court, or the place where the prince (Tusheet [[Genghis Khan|Khan|alias_match_single_candidate]]) and high priest (Bogd [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu|Jebtsundamba Khutugtu|alias_match_single_candidate]]) reside, who are always encamped at no great distance from [[one|NUMBER]] another.

The [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] is much frequented by merchants from [[China|China|alias_match_popular_entity]] and [[Russia|Russia|alias_match_popular_entity]], and other places."

By [[Zanabazar|Zanabazar|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s death in [[1723|DATE]], [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] was the [[Mongolia|Mongolia|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s preeminent monastery in terms of religious authority.

From [[1733|DATE]] to [[1778|DATE]], [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] moved in the vicinity of its [[present|DATE]] location.

In [[1754|DATE]], the Erdene Shanzodba Yam of [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] was given authority to supervise the administrative affairs of the [[Bogd Khan|Bogd|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s subjects.

In [[1758|DATE]], the Qianlong Emperor appointed the [[Khalkha Vice General Sanzaidorj|ORGANIZATION]] as the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Mongols|Mongol|alias_match_popular_redirect]] amban of [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] with full authority to "oversee the [[Ulaanbaatar|Khuree|alias_match_article_entity]] and administer well all the Khutugtu's subjects".

A quarter-century later, in [[1786|DATE]], a decree issued in [[Beijing|Peking|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] gave right to the [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] ambans to decide the administrative affairs of Tusheet [[Genghis Khan|Khan|alias_match_single_candidate]] and Setsen [[Genghis Khan|Khan|alias_match_single_candidate]] territories.

With this, [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] became the highest civil authority in [[Mongolia|the country|non_person_coref]].

Based on [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[Mongols|Mongol|alias_match_popular_redirect]] governor [[Sanzaidorj|PERSON]]'s petition, the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong Emperor|annotation]] officially recognized an annual ceremony on [[Bogd Khan Mountain|Bogd Khan Mountain|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[1778|DATE]] and provided the annual imperial donations.

By [[1778|DATE]], [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] may have had as many as [[ten thousand|NUMBER]] monks, who were regulated by a monastic rule, Internal Rule of the [[Grand Monastery|ORGANIZATION]] or "Yeke Kuriyen-u Doto'adu Durem".

In [[1855|DATE]], the part of the camp that moved to Tolgoit was brought back to its [[1778|DATE]] location, and the [[7th|ORDINAL]] Bogd [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu|Jebtsundamba|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] returned to the Zuun [[Ulaanbaatar|Khuree|alias_match_article_entity]].

Following the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)|Treaty of Kyakhta|annotation]] in [[1727|DATE]], [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]]) was a major point of the [[Kyakhta trade|Kyakhta trade|annotation]] between [[Russia|Russia|alias_match_popular_entity]] and [[China|China|alias_match_popular_entity]] – mostly Siberian furs for [[Rail transport in China|Chinese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] cloth and later tea.

The route ran south to [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]], southeast across the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi Desert|annotation]] to [[Kalgan|PERSON]], and southeast over [[Bogd Khan Mountain|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s to [[Beijing|Peking|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] was also a collection point for goods coming from further west.

The [[Moscow|Moscow|alias_match_match_candidate]] trade expedition of [[the 1910s|DATE]] estimated the population of [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] at [[60,000|NUMBER]], based on [[Nikolay Przhevalsky|Nikolay Przhevalsky|annotation]]'s study in [[the 1870s|DATE]].

In [[1911|DATE]], with the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty|annotation]] in [[China|China|alias_match_popular_entity]] headed for total collapse, [[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] leaders in [[Ulaanbaatar|Ikh Khüree|alias_match_article_entity]] for [[Naadam|Naadam|annotation]] met in secret on [[Bogd Khan Mountain|Mount Bogd Khan Uul|alias_match_single_candidate]] and resolved to end [[220 years|DURATION]] of [[Manchu people|Manchu|annotation]] control of their country.

[[Ulaanbaatar|Khüree|alias_match_article_entity]] as the seat of the [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu|Jebtsundamba Khutugtu|alias_match_single_candidate]] was the logical choice for [[Ulaanbaatar|the capital|non_person_coref]] of the new state.

In [[1919|DATE]], [[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] nobles, over the opposition of the [[Bogd Khan|Bogd Khan|alias_match_match_candidate]], agreed with the [[Rail transport in China|Chinese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] resident [[Chen Yi|Chen Yi|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] on a settlement of the "[[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] question" along [[Qing dynasty|Qing-era|alias_match_single_candidate]] lines, but before this settlement could be put into effect, [[Ulaanbaatar|Khüree|alias_match_article_entity]] was occupied by the troops of [[Rail transport in China|Chinese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] warlord [[Xu Shuzheng|Xu Shuzheng|annotation]], who forced the [[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] nobles and clergy to renounce autonomy completely.

[[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg|Baron Ungern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s capture of [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]] was followed by clearing out [[Mongolia|Mongolia|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s small gangs of demoralized [[Rail transport in China|Chinese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] soldiers and, at the same time, looting and murder of foreigners, including a vicious pogrom that killed off the Jewish community.

However, at the same time that [[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg|Baron Ungern|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was taking control of [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]], a Soviet-supported [[Communism|Communist|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] force led by [[Damdin Sükhbaatar|Damdin Sükhbaatar|annotation]] was forming in [[Russia|Russia|alias_match_popular_entity]], and in [[March|DATE]] they crossed the border.

In [[July 1921|DATE]], the [[Communism|Communist|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Soviet-[[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] army became the [[second|ORDINAL]] conquering force in [[six months|DURATION]] to enter [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga|alias_match_article_entity]].

On [[29 October 1924|DATE]], [[Karakorum|the town|non_person_coref]] was renamed [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[Mongolia|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] "red hero"), by the advice of T.R.

[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] hosted the official [[2019|DATE]] [[FIBA 3x3 Under-18 World Cup|FIBA 3x3 Under-18 World Cup|annotation]] where [[Mongolia men's national 3x3 team|Mongolia's national Under-18 3x3 team|annotation]] finished [[6th|ORDINAL]] out of [[20|NUMBER]].

[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] is served by the [[Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport|Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport|annotation]] (formerly [[Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport|Buyant Ukhaa Airport|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]).

Flights to [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] are available from [[Moscow|Moscow|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Paris|Paris|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Berlin|Berlin|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Tokyo|Tokyo|annotation]], [[Seoul|Seoul|annotation]], [[Ulan-Ude|Ulan-Ude|annotation]], [[Irkutsk|Irkutsk|annotation]], [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong|annotation]], [[Beijing|Beijing|annotation]], [[Bishkek|Bishkek|annotation]] and [[Istanbul|Istanbul|annotation]].

. [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] is connected by road to most of the major towns in [[Mongolia|Mongolia|alias_match_match_candidate]], but most roads in [[Mongolia|Mongolia|alias_match_match_candidate]] are unpaved and unmarked, and road travel can be difficult. Even within [[Istanbul|the city|non_person_coref]], not all roads are paved and some of the ones that are paved are not in good condition.

Existing plans to improve transportation include a subway system, several major road projects such as a [[1,000|NUMBER]] km highway to link [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Hong Kong|the region|non_person_coref]]s of Altanbulag and [[Zamyn-Üüd|Zamyn Uud|annotation]], plans to upgrade existing regional airports and roadways, and [[Mongolian script|Mongolian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Railway projects that will connect cities and mines.

There is also an [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] trolleybus system.

Additionally, [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] has over [[4000|NUMBER]] taxis.

[[Ulaanbaatar|the capital|non_person_coref]] has [[418.2|NUMBER]] km of road, of which [[76.5|NUMBER]] are paved.

Air pollution is a serious problem in [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]], especially in [[winter|DATE]].

The problem is compounded by [[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]]'s location in a valley between relatively high mountains, which shield [[Istanbul|the city|non_person_coref]] from the [[winter|DATE]] winds and thus obstruct air circulation.

[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] is twinned with:

[[Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar|alias_match_article_entity]] has friendly relations with:

Humphry Osmond

[[Humphry Osmond|Humphry Fortescue Osmond|annotation]] ([[1 July 1917|DATE]] – [[6 February 2004|DATE]]) was an [[English people|English|annotation]] psychiatrist who expatriated to [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]], then moved to work in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Humphry Osmond|He|PERSON_coref]] is known for inventing the word "psychedelic" and for [[Humphry Osmond|his|PERSON_coref]] research into interesting and useful applications for psychedelic drugs.

[[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] also explored aspects of the psychology of social environments, in particular how they influenced welfare or recovery in mental institutions.

As a young man, [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] worked for an architect and attended [[Guy's Hospital Medical School|ORGANIZATION]] at [[King's College London|King's College London|annotation]].

While active as a surgeon-lieutenant in the [[Navy|ORGANIZATION]] during World War II, [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] trained to become a psychiatrist.

After the war, [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] joined the psychiatric unit at [[St George's Hospital|St George's Hospital|annotation]], [[London|London|alias_match_popular_entity]] where [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] rose to become senior registrar.

[[Humphry Osmond|His|PERSON_coref]] time at [[St George's Hospital|the hospital|non_person_coref]] was to prove pivotal in [[three|NUMBER]] respects: firstly it was where [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] met [[Humphry Osmond|his|PERSON_coref]] wife [[Amy "Jane" Roffey|PERSON]] who was working there as a nurse, secondly [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] met Dr [[John Raymond Smythies|John Smythies|annotation]] who was to become [[one|NUMBER]] of [[John Raymond Smythies|his|PERSON_coref]] major collaborators, and thirdly [[John Raymond Smythies|he|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] encountered the drugs that would become associated with [[John Raymond Smythies|his|PERSON_coref]] name (and [[John Raymond Smythies|his|PERSON_coref]] with theirs): LSD and mescaline.

While researching the drugs at [[Saint George|St George|alias_match_popular_redirect]]'s, [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] noticed that they produced similar effects to schizophrenia and [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] became convinced that the disease was caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.

In [[1951|DATE]], [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[John Raymond Smythies|Smythies|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] moved to [[Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan|annotation]], [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]] to join the staff of the [[Souris Valley Mental Health Hospital|Weyburn Mental Hospital|annotation]] in the southeastern city of [[Weyburn|Weyburn|annotation]], [[Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In [[1952|DATE]], [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] related the similarity of mescaline to adrenaline molecules, in a theory which implied that schizophrenia might be a form of self-intoxication caused by [[one|NUMBER]]'s own body.

[[Humphry Osmond|He|PERSON_coref]] collected the biographies of recovered schizophrenics, and [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] held that psychiatrists can only understand the schizophrenic by understanding the rational way the mind makes sense of distorted perceptions.

[[Humphry Osmond|He|PERSON_coref]] pursued this idea with passion, exploring all avenues to gain insight into the shattered perceptions of schizophrenia, holding that the illness arises primarily from distortions of perception.

Yet during the same period, [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] became aware of the potential of psychedelics to foster mind-expanding and mystical experiences.

[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley|alias_match_single_candidate]] had initiated a correspondence with [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]].

In their exchange of letters, [[Aldous Huxley|Huxley|alias_match_single_candidate]] asked [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] if [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] would be kind enough to supply a dose of mescaline.

In [[May|DATE]] of that [[year|DURATION]], [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] traveled to the [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles|LOCATION_popular_entity]] area for a conference and, while there, provided [[Aldous Huxley|Huxley|alias_match_single_candidate]] with the requested dose of mescaline and supervised the ensuing experience in the author's home neighborhood.

Osmond's name appears in [[four|NUMBER]] footnotes in the early pages of [[The Doors of Perception|the book|non_person_coref]] (in references to articles [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had written regarding medicinal use of hallucinogenic drugs).

Osmond was respected and trusted enough that in [[1955|DATE]] [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] was approached by [[Christopher Mayhew|Christopher Mayhew|annotation]] (later, [[Christopher Mayhew|Baron Mayhew|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]), an [[England|English|annotation]] politician, and guided [[Christopher Mayhew|Mayhew|alias_match_single_candidate]] through a mescaline trip that was filmed for broadcast by the [[BBC|BBC|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]].

[[Humphry Osmond|Humphry Osmond|alias_match_article_entity]] [[first|ORDINAL]] proposed the term "psychedelic" at a meeting of the [[New York Academy of Sciences|New York Academy of Sciences|annotation]] in [[1956|DATE]].

[[Humphry Osmond|He|PERSON_coref]] said the word meant "mind manifesting" (from "mind", ψυχή (psyche), and "manifest", δήλος (delos)) and called it "clear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations."

[[One|NUMBER]] of [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s patients during this time was [[Bill W.|Bill W.|annotation]], co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous|annotation]].

Peripherally related to [[Bill W.|his|PERSON_coref]] interest in drug-assisted therapeutics, [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] conducted research on the long-term effects of institutionalization.

[[Humphry Osmond|He|PERSON_coref]] had interpreted and described the peyote ceremony [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]]'d experienced, with its tepee setting and its particular social pattern, in terms that drew attention to its contrast with the psychiatric institutions of [[Humphry Osmond|his|PERSON_coref]] [[day|DURATION]].

Osmond began a line of research into what [[Humphry Osmond|he|PERSON_coref]] called "socio-architecture" to improve patient settings, coining the t

[[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s interests included the application of [[Carl Jung|Jung|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]]'s Typology of personality to group dynamics.

Later, [[Humphry Osmond|Osmond|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] became director of the [[Bureau of Research|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Neurology|LOCATION]] and Psychiatry at the [[New Jersey Neuro Psychiatric Institute|New Jersey Neuro Psychiatric Institute|acronym_entity]] ([[New Jersey Neuro Psychiatric Institute|NJNPI|acronym]]) in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton|annotation]], where he collaborated with [[Bernard Aaronson|PERSON]] in hypnosis experiments.

Peter Gansevoort

[[Peter Gansevoort|Peter Gansevoort|annotation]] ([[July 17, 1749|DATE]] – [[July 2, 1812|DATE]]) was a Colonel in the [[Continental Army|Continental Army|annotation]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War|annotation]].

[[Peter Gansevoort|He|PERSON_coref]] is best known for leading the resistance to [[Barry St. Leger|Barry St. Leger|annotation]]'s [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|Siege of Fort Stanwix|annotation]] in [[1777|DATE]].

[[Peter Gansevoort|Peter Gansevoort|alias_match_article_entity]] was born into the Dutch aristocracy of [[Albany, New York|Albany, New York|annotation]].

[[Peter Gansevoort|His|PERSON_coref]] parents were [[Harman Gansevoort|PERSON]] ([[1712|DATE]]–[[1801|DATE]]), the [[third|ORDINAL]] generation of [[Peter Gansevoort|his|PERSON_coref]] family to live in [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], and [[Magdalena Douw|ORGANIZATION]] ([[1718|DATE]]–[[1796|DATE]]).

[[Peter Gansevoort|His|PERSON_coref]] younger brother was [[Leonard Gansevoort|Leonard Gansevoort|annotation]], who was more active politically, serving in the state assembly and senate, as well as the [[Continental Congress|Continental Congress|annotation]].

Through [[Harmen Harmense Gansevoort|his|PERSON_coref]] mother, [[Harmen Harmense Gansevoort|he|PERSON_coref]] was related to [[Albany, New York|New York|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family|annotation]] as [[her|PERSON]] mother, and [[Peter Gansevoort|Gansevoort|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s maternal grandmother, was Anna [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer|alias_match_single_candidate]] ([[1696|DATE]]–[[1756|DATE]]), a daughter of [[Hendrick van Rensselaer|Hendrick van Rensselaer|annotation]], the director of the [[Eastern|ORGANIZATION]] patent of the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck|annotation]] manor.

As the [[American Revolution|American Revolution|annotation]] grew closer, [[Peter Gansevoort|Peter Gansevoort|alias_match_article_entity]] joined the [[Albany County militia|Albany County militia|annotation]].

While [[Peter Gansevoort|he|PERSON_coref]] lacked the experience of many older officers, [[Peter Gansevoort|he|PERSON_coref]] was a tactful and persuasive leader.

Even at [[Peter Gansevoort|his|PERSON_coref]] young age, [[Peter Gansevoort|he|PERSON_coref]] was over [[six|NUMBER]] feet tall, and had a commanding presence.

This, along with [[Peter Gansevoort|his|PERSON_coref]] family connections, caused Gen. [[Philip Schuyler|Philip Schuyler|annotation]] to give [[Philip Schuyler|him|PERSON_coref]] a commission.

[[Catherine|She|PERSON_coref]] was the daughter of [[Wessel|PERSON]] and [[Maria Van Schaik|PERSON]], and [[Catherine|her|PERSON_coref]] cousin [[Goose Van Schaick|Goose Van Schaick|annotation]] had been [[Peter Gansevoort|Peter|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s commander and Colonel in [[1775|DATE]].

Dolichorhynchops

"Dolichorhynchops" is an extinct genus of polycotylid plesiosaur from the [[Late Cretaceous|Late Cretaceous|annotation]] (early [[Turonian|Turonian|annotation]] to late [[Campanian|Campanian|annotation]] stage) of [[North America|North America|annotation]], containing [[three|NUMBER]] species, "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]", "D. bonneri" and "D. tropicensis", as well as a questionably referred [[fourth|ORDINAL]] species, "D. herschelensis".

"[[Dolichorhynchops|Dolichorhynchops|alias_match_article_entity]]" was an oceangoing prehistoric reptile.

The holotype specimen of "[[Dolichorhynchops|Dolichorhynchops osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]" was discovered in the upper Smoky Hill Chalk [[Logan County|Logan County|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]], [[Kansas|Kansas|LOCATION_popular_entity]], by [[George F. Sternberg|PERSON]], as a teenager, in around [[1900|DATE]].

The specimen of "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]" on exhibit at the [[Sternberg|PERSON]], FHSM VP-404 was found by [[Marion Bonner|PERSON]] near [[Russell Springs|Russell Springs|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]] in [[Logan County|Logan County|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]] in [[the early 1950s|DATE]].

Until [[recently|DATE]], all known specimens of "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]" in [[Kansas|Kansas|LOCATION_popular_entity]] had been collected from the upper layers of the Smoky Hill Chalk ([[Campanian|Campanian age|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]).

In [[2005|DATE]], the remains of the earliest known "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]" were discovered in the [[Fort Hays Limestone|LOCATION]], [[Niobrara Formation|Niobrara Formation|annotation]] in [[Jewell County|LOCATION]], [[Kansas|Kansas|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Unknown to [[Marion Bonner|her|PERSON_coref]] at the [[time|DATE]], [[Carpenter|PERSON]] ([[1996|DATE]]) had revised the Polycotylidae and separated "[[Dolichorhynchops|Dolichorhynchops|alias_match_article_entity]]" from "Trinacromerum", raising the question as to whether or not the specimens represented a separate species or just larger individuals of "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]".

A study in [[2008|DATE]] found that "T. bonneri" is a valid species of "[[Dolichorhynchops|Dolichorhynchops|alias_match_article_entity]]", "D. bonneri".

It is also believed to have been substantially smaller than its close relative, "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|annotation]]", as some juvenile specimens of "[[Dolichorhynchops|D. osborni|alias_match_article_entity]]" are larger than the adult specimen of "D. herschelensis".

"D. tropicensis" extends the known stratigraphic range for "[[Dolichorhynchops|Dolichorhynchops|alias_match_article_entity]]" back by approximately [[7 million years|DURATION]].

According to [[Ethnologue|Ethnologue|annotation]], there are an estimated [[71,400|NUMBER]] [[Soqotri people|Soqotri|alias_match_article_entity]].

Most [[Soqotri people|Soqotri|alias_match_article_entity]] are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim|annotation]].

This led to slow Islamisation of the [[Soqotri people|Soqotri|alias_match_article_entity]].

The [[Soqotri people|Soqotri|alias_match_article_entity]] speak the [[Soqotri language|Soqotri language|annotation]] (also known as [[Saqatri|LOCATION]], [[Soqotri language|Socotri|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Soqotri language|Sokotri|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and Suqutri).

Reed's School

[[Reed's School|Reed's School|annotation]] is an independent secondary boarding school for boys with a mixed [[Sixth|ORDINAL]] form located in [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham, Surrey|annotation]], [[England|England|annotation]].

[[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] was founded in [[1813|DATE]], by [[Andrew Reed (minister)|Rev. Andrew Reed, D.D.|annotation]] and incorporated by [[Act of Parliament|Act of Parliament|annotation]] in [[1845|DAT

. Since [[1951|DATE]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II|annotation]] has acted as [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]]'s [[15th|ORDINAL]] patron and has visited [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] twice, in [[1997|DATE]] and in [[2014|DATE]], as the reigning monarch. Members of the Alumni are known as ’Old Reedonians’.

[[A month later|DATE]], on [[27 July|DATE]] the East [[Reed's School|London Orphan Asylum|alias_match_article_entity]] was formally established.

Reed was able to secure financial support from the [[Stock Exchange|ORGANIZATION]] and City [[Livery company|Livery Companies|annotation]], again establishing a tradition which has continued throughout the history of [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]].

[[James Capel|PERSON]] of the stock broking firm of that name was a prominent early member of the board of managers ([[one|NUMBER]] of [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] houses is named after [[James Capel|him|PERSON_coref]]).

During the asylum's time in East [[London|London|alias_match_popular_entity]], it was famous for having had some [[2000|DATE]] hymns written for it by the [[England|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] architect [[James Edmeston|James Edmeston|annotation]] ([[one|NUMBER]] [[each|SET]] [[Sunday|DATE]]), a strong supporter of and frequent visitor to the [[Reed's School|London Orphan Asylum|alias_match_article_entity]].

In [[November 1866|DATE]] a typhoid epidemic killed [[15|NUMBER]] children and precipitated the board of managers into a decision to move [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] to a new site.

[[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] was formally opened in [[1871|DATE]].

It was renamed "[[Reed's School|London Orphan School|alias_match_article_entity]]" in [[1915|DATE]] (finally, in [[1939|DATE]], this was changed to "[[Reed's School|Reed's School|alias_match_article_entity]]" in honour of the founder).

During [[World War II|World War II|annotation]] [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] was evacuated from [[Watford|Watford|alias_match_popular_entity]]; the boys to the [[Seymour Hotel|PERSON]], [[Totnes|Totnes|annotation]] and the girls to a number of houses near [[Towcester|Towcester|annotation]].

After [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]] the governors decided not to return to [[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]] at [[Watford|Watford|alias_match_popular_entity]], which the government in any case wished to retain as a headquarters building for the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour|alias_match_single_candidate]].

In [[1950|DATE]], [[Reed's School|Reed's School|alias_match_article_entity]] began to take fee-paying pupils, while retaining its charitable element.

[[Reed's School|the school|non_person_coref]]'s prayer, penned by the founder [[The Reverend|Rev|alias_match_single_candidate]]. [[Andrew Reed (minister)|Andrew Reed|alias_match_single_candidate]], is recited at each chapel service:

The leaves of "[[Scadoxus|Scadoxus|alias_match_article_entity]]" species are thin, spirally arranged, with a distinct stalk (petiole); in some species their bases form a pseudostem.

The cultivation of "[[Scadoxus|Scadoxus|alias_match_article_entity]]" species has been described by [[Jonathan Hutchinson|PERSON]], the UK [[National Plant Collection|National Plant Collection|annotation]] holder for the genus.

Pests of "[[Scadoxus|Scadoxus|alias_match_article_entity]]" in cultivation in the UK include mealy bugs and narcissus bulb fly ("[[Merodon equestris|Merodon equestris|annotation]]").

The genus "[[Scadoxus|Scadoxus|alias_match_article_entity]]" is known to have some strongly toxic species, containing poisonous alkaloids.

"[[Scadoxus multiflorus|Scadoxus multiflorus|alias_match_match_candidate]]" and "[[Scadoxus|Scadoxus|alias_match_article_entity]] cinnabarinus" are traditionally used in parts of tropical [[Africa|Africa|alias_match_match_candidate]] as components of arrow poisons and fishing poisons.

[[Maira Kalman|PERSON]], who provided the illustrations for "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]] Illustrated" ([[2005|DATE]], see below), asked [[Nico Muhly|Nico Muhly|annotation]] to compose a cantata based on [[The Elements of Style|the book|non_person_coref]].

[[William Strunk Jr.|He|PERSON_coref]] also produced the [[second|ORDINAL]] ([[1972|DATE]]) and [[third|ORDINAL]] ([[1979|DATE]]) editions of "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]", by which time [[The Elements of Style|the book|non_person_coref]]'s length had extended to [[85|NUMBER]] pages.

The [[third|ORDINAL]] edition of "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]" ([[1979|DATE]]) features [[54|NUMBER]] points: a list of common word-usage errors; [[11|NUMBER]] rules of punctuation and grammar; [[11|NUMBER]] principles of writing; [[11|NUMBER]] matters of form; and, in Chapter V, [[21|NUMBER]] reminders for better style.

The final reminder, the [[21st|ORDINAL]], "Prefer the standard to the offbeat", is thematically integral to the subject of "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]", yet does stand as a discrete essay about writing lucid prose.

The [[fourth|ORDINAL]] edition of "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]" ([[2000|DATE]]), published [[54 years|DURATION]] after [[William Strunk Jr.|Strunk|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s death, omits [[William Strunk Jr.|his|PERSON_coref]] stylistic advice about masculine pronouns: "unless the antecedent is or must be feminine".

[[Five years later|DATE]], the [[fourth|ORDINAL]] edition text was re-published as "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]] Illustrated" ([[2005|DATE]]), with illustrations by the designer [[Maira Kalman|Maira Kalman|annotation]].

"[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]" was listed as [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[100|NUMBER]] best and most influential books written in [[English studies|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] since [[1923|DATE]] by "[[Time (magazine)|Time|alias_match_single_candidate]]" in its [[2011|DATE]] list.

American poet [[Dorothy Parker|Dorothy Parker|annotation]] has, regarding [[The Elements of Style|the book|non_person_coref]], said:If you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second-greatest favor you can do them is to [[present|DATE]] them with copies of "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]".

Criticism of "[[The Elements of Style|Strunk & White|alias_match_article_entity]]" has largely focused on claims that it has a prescriptivist nature, or that it has become a general anachronism in the face of modern [[English studies|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] usage.

In criticizing "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]", [[Geoffrey K. Pullum|Geoffrey Pullum|annotation]], professor of linguistics at the [[University of Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh|annotation]], and co-author of "[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] Cambridge Grammar of the [[English language|English Language|alias_match_popular_redirect]]" ([[2002|DATE]]), said that: "[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] book's toxic mix of purism, atavism, and personal eccentricity is not underpinned by a proper grounding in [[English studies|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] grammar.

Several generations of college students learned their grammar from the uninformed bossiness of "[[The Elements of Style|Strunk and White|alias_match_article_entity]]", and the result is a nation of educated people who know they feel vaguely anxious and insecure whenever they write "however" or "than me" or "was" or "which", but can't tell you why."

On "[[Language Log|Language Log|annotation]]", a blog about language written by linguists, [[Geoffrey K. Pullum|he|PERSON_coref]] further criticized "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]" for promoting linguistic prescriptivism and hypercorrection among [[English-speaking world|Anglophones|annotation]], and called it "[[The Elements of Style|the book|non_person_coref]] that ate [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]]'s brain".

"[[The Boston Globe|The Boston Globe|annotation]]" review described "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]] Illustrated" ([[2005|DATE]]), with illustrations by [[Maira Kalman|Maira Kalman|alias_match_match_candidate]], as an "aging zombie of a book ... a hodgepodge, its now-antiquated pet peeves jostling for space with [[1970s|DATE]] taboos and [[1990s|DATE]] computer advice".

. Rule [[17|NUMBER]] in the chapter titled Principles of Composition is '[[The Elements of Style|Omit needless words|alias_match_article_entity]].' I will try to do that here."

In [[2011|DATE]], [[Tim Skern|PERSON]] remarked (perhaps equivocally) that "[[The Elements of Style|The Elements of Style|alias_match_article_entity]]" "remains the best book available on writing good [[English studies|English|alias_match_single_candidate]]".

Titles Deprivation Act 1917

The [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917|Titles Deprivation Act 1917|annotation]] is an [[Act of Parliament|Act of Parliament|annotation]] of the United Kingdom which authorised enemies of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom|LOCATION_popular_entity]] during the [[World War I|First World War|annotation]] to be deprived of their British peerages and royal titles.

In [[1917|DATE]], therefore, [[House of Lords|Parliament|alias_match_single_candidate]] passed the [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917|Titles Deprivation Act|alias_match_article_entity]] authorising the deprivation of peerage titles, as well as princely dignities.





Tiberius Claudius Candidus

[[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Tiberius Claudius Candidus|annotation]] (died c. [[198|NUMBER]] CE) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman|annotation]] general and senator.

[[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|He|PERSON_coref]] played an important role supporting [[Septimius Severus|Septimius Severus|annotation]] in the struggle for succession following the assassination of the emperor [[Pertinax|Pertinax|annotation]] in [[193|NUMBER]] CE.

While [[Commodus|the emperor|non_person_coref]] was stationed at [[Perinthus|LOCATION]], [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Candidus|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] took [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|his|PERSON_coref]] troops and crossed the [[Sea of Marmara|Propontis|annotation]], meeting and defeating [[Niger|Niger|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s forces (under the command of Asellius Aemilianus) at the Battle of Cyzicus.

In the aftermath, Aemilianus was captured and brought before [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Candidus|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], who had [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|him|PERSON_coref]] executed.

[[Niger|Niger|alias_match_popular_entity]] himself arrived to take command of [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|his|PERSON_coref]] troops at [[İznik|Nicaea|annotation]], and at the Battle of [[İznik|Nicaea|alias_match_single_candidate]] fought against [[Septimius Severus|Severus|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s army under Candidus.

With [[Niger|Niger|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s defeat at [[Battle of Issus (194)|Issus|alias_match_single_candidate]] and subsequent death, [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Candidus|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was appointed "Dux adversus rebelles [[Asia (Roman province)|Asiae|alias_match_single_candidate]]", tasked with dealing with [[Niger|Niger|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s remaining supporters in the eastern provinces.

Following this, [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Candidus|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] rejoined [[Septimius Severus|Severus|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[Septimius Severus|his|PERSON_coref]] "[[Roman–Parthian Wars|Expeditio Mesopotamena|annotation]]" against the Parthians in [[195|NUMBER]] CE, where Candidus was [[once|DATE]] again appointed "dux exercitus Illyrici".

After campaigning against [[Adiabene|Adiabene|annotation]] and [[Osroene|Osroene|annotation]], [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Candidus|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was sent back to the western provinces, as [[Clodius Albinus|Clodius Albinus|annotation]] declared himself [[Roman emperor|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] in [[196|NUMBER]] and invaded the [[Roman Gaul|Gallic provinces|annotation]].

It was during this period (either [[195|NUMBER]] or [[196|NUMBER]]) that [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|Candidus|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was appointed suffect consul "in absentia".

Arriving in [[Noricum|Noricum|annotation]], [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus|he|PERSON_coref]] carried the title "Dux adversus rebelles Noricae", and was given the task of rounding up [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s supporters in the province.





Micheline (railcar)

[[Micheline (railcar)|Michelines|annotation]] were a series of rubber-tyred trains developed in [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[the 1930s|DATE]] by various rail companies and rubber-tyre manufacturer [[Michelin|Michelin|annotation]].





Zapruder film

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|annotation]] is a silent [[8|NUMBER]]mm color motion picture sequence shot by [[Abraham Zapruder|Abraham Zapruder|annotation]] with a [[Bell & Howell|Bell & Howell|annotation]] home-movie camera, as [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]] President [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy|annotation]]'s motorcade passed through [[Dealey Plaza|Dealey Plaza|annotation]] in [[Dallas|Dallas|annotation]], [[Texas|Texas|alias_match_popular_entity]], on [[November 22, 1963|DATE]].

Even though it is not the only film of the shooting, the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] has been described as being the most complete [[one|NUMBER]], giving a relatively clear view from a somewhat elevated position on the side from which [[John F. Kennedy|the president|non_person_coref]]'s fatal head wound is visible.

Of greatest notoriety is the film's capture of the fatal shot to [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s head when [[John F. Kennedy|his|PERSON_coref]] presidential limousine was almost exactly in front of, and slightly below, [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s position.

After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service|annotation]] agent [[Forrest Sorrels|PERSON]] promised [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] that [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]] would only be used for an official investigation, the [[two|NUMBER]] men sought to develop the footage as soon as possible.

[[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] gave [[two|NUMBER]] of the copies to [[Sorrels|PERSON]] and they were sent to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington|annotation]].

The original film was retained by [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]], in addition to [[one|NUMBER]] of the copies.

In [[Dan Rather|his|PERSON_coref]] [[2001|DATE]] book "Tell Me A Story", [[CBS|CBS|alias_match_match_candidate]] producer [[Don Hewitt|Don Hewitt|annotation]] said that [[Don Hewitt|he|PERSON_coref]] told [[Dan Rather|Rather|alias_match_single_candidate]] to go to [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s home to "sock [[Dan Rather|him|PERSON_coref]] in the jaw", take [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]], copy it, then return it and let the network's lawyers deal with the consequences.

, [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] insisted that frame [[313|NUMBER]] be excluded from publication.

The [[November 29, 1963|DATE]] issue of "[[Life (magazine)|Life|alias_match_single_candidate]]" published about [[30|NUMBER]] frames of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] in black and white.

[[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of at least [[32|NUMBER]] people in [[Dealey Plaza|Dealey Plaza|alias_match_match_candidate]] known to have made film or still photographs at or around the time of the shooting.

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] frames that were used by the [[Warren Commission|Warren Commission|alias_match_match_candidate]] were publi

Volume [[18|NUMBER]] of the commission's hearings reproduced [[158|NUMBER]] frames from the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] in black and white.

"[[Life (magazine)|Life|alias_match_single_candidate]]" released those missing frames from the first-generation copy it had received from [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]]'s original version; the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] frames outside the section used in the commission's exhibits, frames [[155|NUMBER]]–[[157|NUMBER]] and [[341|NUMBER]], were also damaged and were spliced out of the original rendition of [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]], but are [[present|DATE]] in the first-generation copies.)

A U.S. [[District|District|alias_match_popular_entity]] Court ruled in [[1968|DATE]] that the [[Time Inc.|Time Inc.|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] copyright of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] was not violated by invoking the doctrine of fair use.

In [[1967|DATE]], "[[Life (magazine)|Life|alias_match_single_candidate]]" hired [[New Jersey|New Jersey|LOCATION_popular_entity]] film lab [[Manhattan|Manhattan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] Effects to make a [[16|NUMBER]] mm film copy of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]]'s original version.

Hired in [[1969|DATE]], employee and assassination buff [[Robert J. Groden|Robert Groden|annotation]] used [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Weitzman|PERSON]]'s copies and an optical printer to make versions of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] with close-ups and minimize the shakiness of [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s camera.

[[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s film was aired as part of a [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles|LOCATION_popular_entity]] area television newscast on [[February 14, 1969|DATE]].

The [[first|ORDINAL]] broadcast of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] was on the late-night television show "Underground News" with [[Chuck Collins|PERSON]], originating on WSNS-TV, Ch [[44|NUMBER]], [[Chicago|Chicago|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1970|DATE]].

Australians became the [[first|ORDINAL]] mass audience in the world to view the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] on the [[Seven National News Network|ORGANIZATION]] and [[a few minutes later|DATE]] the [[Nine News National Network|ORGANIZATION]], on [[February 5, 1975|DATE]].

On [[March 6, 1975|DATE]], on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC|annotation]] late-night television show "Good Night America" (hosted by [[Geraldo Rivera|Geraldo Rivera|annotation]]), assassination researchers [[Robert J. Groden|Robert Groden|annotation]] and [[Dick Gregory|Dick Gregory|annotation]] presented the first-ever US network television showing of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]].

In [[April 1975|DATE]], in settlement of a royalties suit between [[Time Inc.|Time Inc.|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] and [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s heirs that arose from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC|alias_match_single_candidate]] showing, [[Time Inc.|Time Inc.|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] sold [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]]'s initial rendition and its copyright back to the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family for the token sum of [[$1|MONEY]].

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family originally refused to consent, but in [[1978|DATE]], the family transferred [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]] to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives and Records Administration|annotation]] for appropriate preservation and safe-keeping, while still retaining ownership of [[Kodachrome|the film|non_person_coref]] and its copyright.

Director [[Oliver Stone|Oliver Stone|annotation]] paid over [[$85,000|MONEY]] to the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family for use of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Oliver Stone|his|PERSON_coref]] motion picture "[[JFK (film)|JFK|annotation]]" ([[1991|DATE]]).

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] was automatically designated an "assassination record" and therefore became the official property of the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]] government.

When the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family demanded the return of the original film between [[1993|DATE]] [[and|DATE]] [[1994|DATE]], [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives|alias_match_single_candidate]] officials refused to comply.

On [[April 24, 1997|DATE]], the [[Assassination Records Review Board|Assassination Records Review Board|acronym_entity]] ([[Assassination Records Review Board|ARRB|acronym]]), which the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|JFK Act|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] created, announced a "Statement of Policy and Intent with Regard to the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder Film|alias_match_article_entity]]".

The ARRB re-affirmed that the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] was an "assassination record" within the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|JFK Act|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s meaning and directed it to be transferred on [[August 1, 1998|DATE]] from its present-day location in [[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s film collection to the [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy|alias_match_match_candidate]] Assassination Records Collection maintained by [[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

As required by the [[Constitution of the United States|US federal law|annotation]] for such a seizure under eminent domain, payment to [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s heirs was attempted.

Because [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] is unique, its value was difficult to ascertain; eventually, following arbitration with the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] heirs, the government purchased [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] in [[1999|DATE]] for [[$16 million|MONEY]].

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family retained copyright to [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], which was not seized.

In [[1997|DATE]], [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] was digitally replicated and restored under license of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family.

The [[1998|DATE]] documentary "Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder Film|alias_match_article_entity]]" shows history of [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], as well as various versions of when it was restored.

In [[December 1999|DATE]], the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family donated [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]]'s copyright to the [[Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza|Sixth Floor Museum|annotation]], in the [[Texas School Book Depository|Texas School Book Depository|annotation]] building at [[Dealey Plaza|Dealey Plaza|annotation]], along with [[one|NUMBER]] of the first-generation copies made on [[November 22, 1963|DATE]] and other copies of [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] and frame enlargements [[once|DATE]] held by "[[Life (magazine)|Life|alias_match_single_candidate]]" magazine, which had since been returned.

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] family no longer retains any commercial rights to [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], which are [[now|DATE]] entirely controlled by the museum.

Every frame of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] has been put together into a panoramic movie.

The objects' positions are updated during visibility in the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] frames, and they stay motionless [[once|DATE]] each object moves out of those frames.

The [[Orville Nix|Nix|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] films were then combined into a direct simultaneous comparison movie.

Between [[November 1963|DATE]] and [[January 1964|DATE]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI|annotation]] examined a copy of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]], noting that the camera recorded at an average of [[18.3|NUMBER]] frames per [[second|ORDINAL]].

There is also a stabilized high-definition version of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] that is synchronized with the [[Dallas|Dallas|alias_match_match_candidate]] Police Department audio recording.

The version of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] used here is the first-generation copy that went to [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

A 3D-rendering of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] was created by computer animator [[Dale Myers|Dale Myers|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] to provide better clarification of what happened during the time of the assassination.

The [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] is often thought to have captured the shooting from beginning to end, and it has been described by some as a "complete record of the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy|alias_match_single_candidate]] assassination".

lland and Rush have pointed out that [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]] temporarily stopped filming at around frame [[132|NUMBER]], when only police motorcycles were visible

Holland and Rush argue that the break in the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] might conceal a [[first|ORDINAL]] shot earlier than analysts have hitherto assumed, and point out that in this case a horizontal traffic mast would temporarily have obstructed [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s view of [[Lee Harvey Oswald|his|PERSON_coref]] target.

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] evidence offered by [[Max Holland|Holland|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and Rush to support their theory was challenged in a series of [[2007|DATE]]–[[08|NUMBER]] articles by computer animator [[Dale K. Myers|Dale K. Myers|annotation]] and assassination researcher [[Todd W. Vaughan|PERSON]], who defended the prevailing belief that [[Zapruder film|Zapruder|alias_match_article_entity]]'s film captured the entire shooting sequence.

Horne discovered the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center|NPIC|acronym_ner]] worked on [[two|NUMBER]] different versions of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] on [[Saturday|DATE]] and [[Sunday|DATE]] [[nights|TIME]] immediately following the assassination, which had occurred [[Friday|DATE]].

When [[Horne|PERSON]] showed [[Dino Brugioni|his|PERSON_coref]] findings and evidence to [[Dino Brugioni|Brugioni|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], the latter re-examined a copy of the extant [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]], provided by [[Horne|PERSON]].

Brugioni then stated the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[today|DATE]], and available to the public, specifically frame [[313|NUMBER]], is an altered version of [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] [[Dino Brugioni|he|PERSON_coref]] saw and worked with on [[November 23|DATE]]–[[24|NUMBER]], the earlier of the [[two|NUMBER]] versions handled by the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center|NPIC|acronym_ner]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] version of the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] available to the public depicts the fatal head shot on only [[one|NUMBER]] frame of [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], frame [[313|NUMBER]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza|Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza|annotation]] denies that the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] has been altered, or that any of the frames are missing from [[JFK (film)|the film|non_person_coref]].

In [[1994|DATE]], the [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]] footage was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[Library of Congress|Library of Congress|annotation]] and was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Film Registry|National Film Registry|annotation]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Zapruder film|Zapruder film|alias_match_article_entity]], kept from public viewing for [[years|DURATION]], has evolved into [[one|NUMBER]] of the most viewed films in history, [[now|DATE]] available on the Internet for public access.

Another version is that [[Oroquieta|Oroquieta|alias_match_article_entity]] had derived its name from the words "oro" (gold) and "quita" or "kita" (to find), in reference to the early inhabitants who had found gold along the river.

[[Oroquieta|Layawan|alias_match_article_entity]] was the original name of [[Oroquieta|Oroquieta|alias_match_article_entity]], which was the barrio in the province of Misamis since [[1861|DATE]] until [[1879|DATE]].

They found so many stray animals along the river, thus they named the place [[Oroquieta|Layawan|alias_match_article_entity]], which means a place of stray animals.

Then in [[1880|DATE]], [[Oroquieta|Layawan|alias_match_article_entity]] changed its name to [[Oroquieta|Oroquieta|alias_match_article_entity]] when it became a town.

There, shipyard workers paused long enough from their labors to accord "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" a tumultuous reception as [[she|PERSON]] passed.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s impending mission was an important [[one|NUMBER]] – [[one|NUMBER]] upon which the fate of [[Malta|the island|non_person_coref]] bastion of [[Malta|Malta|annotation]] hung.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" drew ferry duty [[once|DATE]] again to participate in [[Operation Calendar|Operation Calendar|annotation]], [[one|NUMBER]] of many [[Malta convoys|Malta Convoys|annotation]].

Having landed [[her|PERSON]] torpedo bombers and dive bombers at [[RNAS Hatston|Hatston|annotation]] in [[Orkney|Orkney|annotation]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" loaded [[47|NUMBER]] [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire Mk. V|annotation

and also served in "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s screen.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" and [[her|PERSON]] consorts passed through the [[Strait of Gibraltar|Straits of Gibraltar|annotation]] under cover of the pre-dawn darkness on [[19 April|DATE]], avoiding the possibility of being discovered by Spanish or Axis agents.

At [[04:00 on 20|TIME]] [[April|DATE]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" spotted [[11|NUMBER]] [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman F4F Wildcat|annotation]] fighters on [[her|PERSON]] deck and quickly launched them to form a combat air patrol (CAP) over Force "W".

When the launch was complete, "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" retired toward [[Gibraltar|Gibraltar|alias_match_popular_entity]], having safely delivered [[her|PERSON]] charges.

Accordingly, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Winston Churchill|annotation]], fearing that [[Malta|Malta|alias_match_match_candidate]] would be "pounded to bits", asked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt|alias_match_single_candidate]] to allow "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" to have "another good sting."

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" loaded another contingent of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Vs|alias_match_single_candidate]] at King George V Dock [[Glasgow|Glasgow|alias_match_match_candidate]] and sailed for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] on [[3 May|DATE]].

Again, "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" proceeded unmolested.

This time, the [[Royal Navy|British|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] carrier accompanied "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", and [[she|PERSON]], too, carried a contingent of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] bound for [[Malta|Malta|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The [[two|NUMBER]] Allied carriers reached their launching points [[early on Saturday, 9 May|DATE]], with "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" steaming in column ahead of at a distance of [[1000|DATE]] yd.

At [[06:30|TIME]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" commenced launching planes – [[11|NUMBER]] [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcats|alias_match_single_candidate]] of [[VF-71|VF-71|annotation]] to serve as CAP over the task force.

[[First|ORDINAL]], "Eagle" flew off [[her|PERSON]] [[17|NUMBER]] [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[two|NUMBER]] waves; then "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" flew off [[47|NUMBER]] more.

An auxiliary fuel tank on another aircraft failed to draw; without the additional fuel the pilot could not make [[Malta|Malta|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[James Watt Dock|his|PERSON_coref]] only alternatives were to land on board "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" - with no tailhook - or to ditch and take [[James Watt Dock|his|PERSON_coref]] chances in the water.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" bent on full speed and recovered the plane at [[07:43|TIME]].

The [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] came to a stop just [[15|NUMBER]] ft from the forward edge of the flight deck, making what [[one|NUMBER]] "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" sailor observed to be a "[[one|NUMBER]] wire" landing.

_match_article_entity]]" set sail for the [[British Isles|British Isles|alias_match_match_candidate]] while a [[Kriegsmarine|German|alias_match_single_candidate]] radio station broadcast the startling news that the [[United States Navy###United States Army###United States Army Air Forces|American|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] carrier had been sunk; on [[11 May|DATE]], [[Winston Churchill|Prime Minister Churchill|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] sent a message to "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]": "Many thanks to you all for the timely help. Who said a wasp couldn't sting twice?"

[[Early in May 1942|DATE]], almost simultaneously with "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s [[second|ORDINAL]] [[Malta|Malta|alias_match_match_candidate]] run—[[Operation Bowery|Operation Bowery|annotation]]—the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Battle of the Coral Sea|annotation]] had been fought, then the [[Battle of Midway|Battle of Midway|annotation]] [[a month later|DATE]].

These battles reduced the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] to [[three|NUMBER]] carriers in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and it became imperative to transfer "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]".

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" was hurried back to the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] for alterations and repairs at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Norfolk Navy Yard|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

Departing [[Norfolk|Norfolk|alias_match_popular_entity]] on [[6 June|DATE]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" sailed with TF [[37|NUMBER]] which was built around the carrier and [[Battle of Midway|the battle|non_person_coref]]ship and escorted by , and [[six|NUMBER]] destroyers.

[[Carrier Strike Group 3|the group|non_person_coref]] transited the [[Panama Canal|Panama Canal|annotation]] on [[10 June|DATE]], at which time "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" and [[her|PERSON]] consorts became TF [[18|NUMBER]], the carrier flying the two-star flag of [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[Leigh Noyes|Leigh Noyes|annotation]].

Arriving at [[San Diego|San Diego|annotation]] on [[19 June|DATE]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" embarked the remainder of [[her|PERSON]] complement of aircraft, [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBF-1 Avenger|annotation]]s and [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless|annotation]]es, the latter replacing the old Vindicators.

On [[Independence Day (United States)|4 July|alias_match_single_candidate]], while "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" was "en route" to the [[Oceania|South Pacific|annotation]], the [[Japan|Japanese|alias_match_single_candidate]] landed on [[Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal|annotation]].

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" – together with the carriers and – was assigned to the [[Support Force|ORGANIZATION]] under [[Vice admiral|Vice Admiral|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Jack Fletcher|annotation]].

Under the tactical command of [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[Leigh Noyes|Noyes|alias_match_single_candidate]], embarked on "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", the carriers were to provide air support for the invasion and initiation of the [[Guadalcanal campaign|Guadalcanal campaign|annotation]].

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" and [[her|PERSON]] airmen practiced [[day|DURATION]] and [[night|TIME]] operations to hone their skills until [[Captain (naval)|Captain|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Forrest Sherman|Sherman|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was confident that [[Forrest Sherman|his|PERSON_coref]] airmen could perform their mission.

"En route", "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s engines became a problem, with a [[14 July|DATE]] message from [[CTF|ORGANIZATION]] [[18|NUMBER]] to CINCPAC reporting that [[she|PERSON]] had suffered a casualty to [[her|PERSON]] starboard high-pressure turbine that even at lowest speeds was making a loud scraping noise, limiting speed to only [[15|NUMBER]] [[kn|ORGANIZATION]] under [[her|PERSON]] port engine thus making air operations entirely dependent on favorable wind.

[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]]'s company was undertaking repairs, including lifting the turbine casing.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" arrived [[18 July|DATE]] for those repairs and on [[21 July|DATE]] ([[21|NUMBER]] [[0802 July|DATE]]) CTF [[18|NUMBER]] reported "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" had successfully completed a trial making turns for [[twenty-seven|NUMBER]] knots with pre-casualty [[twenty-five|NUMBER]] knot operations possible with reduced reliability.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", screened by the heavy cruiser and , and [[four|NUMBER]] destroyers, steamed westward toward [[Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal|alias_match_match_candidate]] on [[the evening of 6|TIME]] [[August|DATE]] until [[midnight|TIME]].

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s [[first|ORDINAL]] combat air patrol fighter took off at [[05:57|TIME]].

None of "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s planes was shot down, but [[Ensign Reeves|PERSON]] landed [[Ensign Kenton|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcat|alias_match_single_candidate]] aboard "Enterprise" after running low on fuel.

At [[07:04|TIME]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" launched [[12|NUMBER]] [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Avengers|alias_match_single_candidate]] loaded with bombs for use against land targets, and led by [[Lieutenant|Lieutenant|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[H. A. Romberg|PERSON]].

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", "Saratoga", and "Enterprise" – with their screens – retired to the southward at nightfall.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" fighters led by [[Lieutenant|Lieutenant|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[C. S. Moffett|PERSON]] maintained a continuous CAP over the transport area until [[noon on 8|TIME]] [[August|DATE]].

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s casualties for the entire action on [[7|NUMBER]] and [[8 August|DATE]] were:

Total plane losses for "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" were [[3|NUMBER]] [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcat|alias_match_single_candidate]] fighters and [[1|NUMBER]] [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Dauntless|alias_match_single_candidate]] scout bomber.

[[Robert L. Ghormley|Ghormley|alias_match_single_candidate]] approved the recommendation, and "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" joined "Enterprise" and "Saratoga" in retiring from [[Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Early on 9 August|DATE]], a [[Japan|Japanese|alias_match_single_candidate]] surface force engaged an [[United States Army|American|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[one|NUMBER]] in the [[Battle of Savo Island|Battle of Savo Island|annotation]] and retired with minimal damage after sinking [[four|NUMBER]] Allied heavy cruisers off [[Savo Island|Savo Island|annotation]], including [[two|NUMBER]] that had served with "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic|alias_match_popular_redirect]]: "[[Vincennes|LOCATION]]" and "[[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy|alias_match_single_candidate]]".

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" was ordered south by Vice [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Admiral Fletcher|alias_match_single_candidate]] to refuel and did not participate in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Battle of the Eastern Solomons|annotation]] on [[24 August|DATE]].

After fueling on [[24 August|DATE]] "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" hurried to [[Battle of Savo Island|the battle|non_person_coref]] zone.

On [[the morning of 25|TIME]] [[August|DATE]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" launched a search mission.

At [[13:26 on 25|TIME]] [[August|DATE]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" launched a search/attack mission of [[24|NUMBER]] [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|SBD Dauntlesses|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[10|NUMBER]] [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBF Avengers|alias_match_single_candidate]] against the convoy of [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[Raizō Tanaka|Raizo Tanaka|annotation]] that seemed to be still within range.

That left only [[two|NUMBER]] carriers in the southwest [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", and , which had been in commission for only [[a year|DURATION]].

On [[Tuesday, 15 September 1942|DATE]], the carriers "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" and "Hornet" and battleship with [[10|NUMBER]] other warships were escorting the transports carrying the [[7th Marine Regiment|ORGANIZATION]] to [[Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal|alias_match_match_candidate]] as reinforcements.

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" was operating some [[150|NUMBER]] [[nmi|ORGANIZATION]] southeast of San Cristobal [[Caribbean|Island|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Her|PERSON]] aircraft were being refueled and rearmed for antisubmarine patrol missions and "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" had been at general quarters from [[an hour|DURATION]] before sunrise until the time when the [[morning|TIME]] search returned to [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] at [[10:00|TIME]].

Thereafter, [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] was in condition [[2|NUMBER]], with the air department at flight quarters.

[[Lieutenant|Lt|alias_match_single_candidate]]. (jg) [[Roland H. Kenton|PERSON]], [[United States Navy Reserve|USNR|alias_match_popular_redirect]], flying a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F-3 Wildcat|alias_match_single_candidate]] of [[VF-71|VF-71|alias_match_match_candidate]] was the last aircraft off the deck of "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]".

[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] rapidly completed the recovery of the [[11|NUMBER]] aircraft before turning to starboard, heeling slightly as [[she|PERSON]] did so.

A spread of [[six|NUMBER]] Type [[95|NUMBER]] torpedoes was fired at "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" at [[about 14:44|TIME]] from the tubes of the [[Type B1 submarine|B1 Type submarine|annotation]] .

"[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" put over [[her|PERSON]] rudder hard to starboard to avoid the salvo, but it was too late.

[[Three|NUMBER]] torpedoes struck in quick succession [[about 14:45|TIME]]; [[one|NUMBER]] actually breached, left the water, and struck [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] slightly above the waterline.

All hit in the vicinity of [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]]'s gasoline tanks and magazines.

[[World War II|Two|alias_match_single_candidate]] of the spread of torpedoes passed ahead of "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" and were observed passing astern of before was hit by [[one|NUMBER]] at [[14:51|TIME]] while maneuvering to avoid the other (structural damage from this torpedo hit would eventually lead to "O'Briens sinking [[a month later|DATE]]).

The [[sixth|ORDINAL]] torpedo passed either astern or under "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", narrowly missed in "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s screen [[about 14:48|TIME]], was seen by in "[[Pacific Ocean|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] Carolina"s screen [[about 14:50|TIME]], and struck "[[Pacific Ocean|North|alias_match_single_candidate]] Carolina" [[about 14:52|TIME]].

There was a rapid succession of explosions in the forward part of [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]].

Soon, the heat of the intense gasoline fires detonated the ready ammunition at the forward anti-aircraft guns on the starboard side, and fragments showered the forward part of [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]].

Water mains in the forward part of [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] had been rendered inoperable meaning no water was available to fight the fire forward, and the fires continued to set off ammunition, bombs, and gasoline.

As [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] listed [[10|NUMBER]]–[[15|NUMBER]]° to starboard, oil and gasoline, released from the tanks by the torpedo hit, caught fire on the water.

The abandonment took [[nearly 40 minutes|DURATION]], and at [[16:00|TIME]] [[Forrest Sherman|Sherman|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] abandoned [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]] [[once|DATE]] [[Forrest Sherman|he|PERSON_coref]] was satisfied that no survivors were left on board.

The fires on "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]", drifting, traveled aft and there were [[four|NUMBER]] violent explosions at nightfall.

The magnetic influence exploders on these were disabled and the depth set at [[10|NUMBER]] ft. All [[three|NUMBER]] detonated, but "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" remained afloat for some time, sinking at [[21:00|TIME]].

All but [[one|NUMBER]] of [[her|PERSON]] [[26|NUMBER]] airborne aircraft made a safe trip to carrier "Hornet" nearby before "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]" sank, but [[45|NUMBER]] aircraft went down with [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|the ship|non_person_coref]].

On [[14 January 2019|DATE]], "[[USS Wasp (CV-7)|Wasp|alias_match_article_entity]]"s wreck was located by the research vessel "Petrel".





Christopher Packe (politician)

[[Christopher Packe (politician)|Sir Christopher Packe|annotation]] ([[1593|DATE]]?

[[Christopher Packe (politician)|Christopher Packe|alias_match_article_entity]] was son of [[Thomas Packe|PERSON]] of [[Kettering|LOCATION]] or [[Grafton|LOCATION]], [[Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and [[Catherine|PERSON]] [[Thomas Packe|his|PERSON_coref]] wife, was born [[about 1593|DATE]].

According to [[Thomas Burton|Thomas Burton|PERSON_human_disambiguation]]'s 'Diary' ([[1828|DATE]], i. [[308|NUMBER]]–[[10|NUMBER]]), [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Packe|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] fought hard at the meeting of the committee of trade on [[6 January 1656|DATE]] – [[1657|DATE]] for the monopoly of the Merchants Adventurers (of which [[Christopher Packe (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] was then governor) in the woollen trade.

The committee, however, decided against [[Christopher Packe (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]].

In [[1654|DATE]] [[Christopher Packe (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of the treasurers (with [[Alderman Vyner|PERSON]]) of the fund collected for the relief of the Protestants in [[Piedmont|Piedmont|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

This involved [[Christopher Packe (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] in considerable trouble.

The money was kept back for [[several years|DURATION]]; various instructions were given [[Christopher Packe (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] by the council for its disposal, and nearly [[£8,000|MONEY]] of the amount was lent by the treasurers to public bodies.

Packe was also [[one|NUMBER]] of the city militia, and treasurer at Avar, receiving in the latter capacity threepence in the pound on all contributions received or paid by [[Christopher Packe (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]].

The sum of [[£16,000|MONEY]] was still due to the state from [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Packe|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Christopher Packe (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] fellow commissioners of customs, and, after several petitions and inquiries by the treasury, [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Packe|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[two|NUMBER]] others were discharged from a share in the obligation, but [[Alderman Avery|PERSON]] and [[Richard Bateman|Richard Bateman|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] were not acquitted.

This clause was thrown out by the Lords on [[1 August|DATE]]; but on [[the next day|DATE]] they resolved that [[sixteen|NUMBER]] persons, among whom [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Packe|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was included, should be disqualified from holding in [[future|DATE]] any public office or employment under penalty of being excepted from the act of pardon.

Packe was accordingly, with [[six|NUMBER]] other [[Commonwealth lord mayors|ORGANIZATION]], removed from the office of alderman, [[Christopher Packe (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] last attendance at the court of aldermen being on [[7 August 1660|DATE]].

[[Christopher Packe (politician)|His|PERSON_coref]] interest at court, however, nearly availed [[Christopher Packe (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] to procure a baronetcy for [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Christopher|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], [[Christopher Packe (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] younger son, a grant for which was issued on [[29 March 1666|DATE]]; but, for some unknown cause, the title was not actually conferred.

[[Christopher Packe (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] also had a suburban house at [[Mortlake|Mortlake|annotation]].

On [[2 March 1649|DATE]] – [[1650|DATE]] the lease of the manor of Prestwold in [[Leicestershire|Leicestershire|LOCATION_popular_entity]] was assigned to [[Christopher Packe (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] by the corporation, who held it in trust for the orphan children of [[John Acton|John Acton|PERSON_human_disambiguation]].

[[Simon Edmonds|He|PERSON_coref]] had no issue by [[Simon Edmonds|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] [[and third|ORDINAL]] wives; but by [[Simon Edmonds|his|PERSON_coref]] [[second|ORDINAL]] wife, [[Anne|PERSON]], who died in [[1657|DATE]], [[Simon Edmonds|he|PERSON_coref]] had [[two|NUMBER]] sons, [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Christopher|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Simon|PERSON]], and [[three|NUMBER]] daughters, [[Anne|PERSON]], [[Mary|PERSON]], and [[Susanna|Susanna|LOCATION_human_disambiguation]].

[[Rags Morales|Morales|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] said "when I saw the magic that [[Michael Bair|Michael Bair|alias_match_article_entity]] added to my work, I knew I had to stick with this dude".

Swan Hennessy

[[Swan Hennessy|Edward Swan Hennessy|annotation]] ([[24 November 1866|DATE]] – [[26 October 1929|DATE]]) was an Irish-American composer and pianist who lived much of [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] life in [[Paris|Paris|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] pre-War piano music, [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] excelled as a miniaturist in descriptive, programmatic music.

After joining a group of [[Breton composers|ORGANIZATION]], [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] developed a reputation as a "Celtic" composer, drawing on [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] Irish heritage, writing in a style that was unique in a French as well as an Irish context.

Even though [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] has been almost forgotten after [[1950|DATE]], [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] music was applauded by contemporary French music critics including [[Henri Collet|Henri Collet|annotation]], [[Louis Vuillemin|Louis Vuillemin|annotation]], [[Émile Vuillermoz|Émile Vuillermoz|annotation]] and [[Lucien Chevaillier|PERSON]].

[[Swan Hennessy|Swan Hennessy|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford, Illinois|annotation]], of Irish origin and grew up in [[Chicago|Chicago|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Swan Hennessy|His|PERSON_coref]] father, [[Michael David Hennessy|PERSON]] ([[1837|DATE]]–[[1919|DATE]]), was a [[Cork (city)|Cork|annotation]]-born former President of the [[Chicago City Railways|ORGANIZATION]] before [[Michael David Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] became a lawyer in [[1874|DATE]].

Upon completing [[Edmund Alwens|his|PERSON_coref]] studies, [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] moved to [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]] ([[1886|DATE]]–[[92|NUMBER]]) where [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] was married with [[two|NUMBER]] children and divorced ([[1893|DATE]]).

[[Ten years|DURATION]] of travel followed, including [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Belgium|Belgium|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Switzerland|Switzerland|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]], with a home base in [[Italy|Italy|LOCATION_popular_entity]], before [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] settled in [[Paris|Paris|LOCATION_popular_entity]] around [[1903|DATE]].

In [[July 1909|DATE]], [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was married with [[Claire|PERSON]], née Przybyszewska ([[1883|DATE]]–[[1947|DATE]]), a Polish national [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] had met in [[Brussels|Brussels|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Although not from [[Brittany|Brittany|annotation]], [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was a member of the short-lived Association des Compositeurs [[Brittany|Breton|alias_match_single_candidate]] before World War I and continued to mix with their members including [[Paul Le Flem|Paul Le Flem|annotation]], [[Paul Ladmirault|Paul Ladmirault|annotation]], [[Maurice Duhamel|Maurice Duhamel|annotation]], [[Louis Aubert|Louis Aubert|annotation]], [[Louis Vuillemin|Louis Vuillemin|annotation]], [[Lucien Haudebert|Lucien Haudebert|annotation]] and others throughout [[the 1920s|DATE]].

During [[the early 1920s|DATE]], [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] also enjoyed a brief period when [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] had several performances in [[Ireland|Ireland|alias_match_popular_entity]] following the [[first|ORDINAL]] performance of [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] String Quartet No. [[2|NUMBER]], Op. [[49|NUMBER]] ([[1920|DATE]]) at the [[January 1922|DATE]] [[World Congress|ORGANIZATION]] of the Irish Race in [[Paris|Paris|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Swan Hennessy|Swan Hennessy|alias_match_article_entity]]'s music before [[1900|DATE]] was heavily influenced by [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] conservative education and [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] teachers' predilection for the music of [[Robert Schumann|Robert Schumann|annotation]].

During the period [[1907|DATE]] to [[1913|DATE]], [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote increasingly in an [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist|annotation]] style, with a prolific series of piano works and art songs in a descriptive and programmatic style inspired by sounds in [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] environment including nature, traffic, and industry.

[[Swan Hennessy|He|PERSON_coref]] also excelled in humoristic and satirical pieces, similar to but independent from [[Erik Satie|Satie|annotation]].

Many of [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s pieces with titles ending on terms like "celtique", "gaélique" or "irlandais" are inspired by traditional folk melody and rhythms, but [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] rarely quotes actual folktunes.

In the course of [[the 1920s|DATE]] [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] wrote most of [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] chamber music, including several dueos, trios and quartets.

These earned [[Swan Hennessy|him|PERSON_coref]] the reputation of a "Celtic" composer to the extent that [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] original pre-War piano music became forgotten.

In a [[French Revolution|French|alias_match_single_candidate]] obituary, [[Swan Hennessy|he|PERSON_coref]] was called "le barde de l'Irlande" and is credited as having saved "l'ancienne mélodie celtique".

From the time [[Swan Hennessy|Hennessy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] lived in [[Paris|Paris|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Swan Hennessy|his|PERSON_coref]] music was largely published by [[Eugène Demets|E. Demets|annotation]] and from [[1923|DATE]] by [[Max Eschig|Max Eschig|annotation]] (who had taken over Demets).

Following in the footsteps of women performance artists of [[the 1980s|DATE]], who consistently probed the boundaries between various manifestations of mass culture in art and lived experience, [[Venia Bechrakis|Bechrakis|alias_match_article_entity]] investigates throughout [[Zina Athanassiadou Gallery|her|PERSON_coref]] work gender and identity issues, the relationship between the public and the private, real and fictitious space.

Shifting between the art of performance, photography in its emancipated form, the composition of classical painting and a cinematic representation of reality, [[Venia Bechrakis|Bechrakis|alias_match_article_entity]] creates pictures that merge theatrical performances (tableaux-vivants) with a documentarian view, exploring the fine line between autobiography and fiction.

Room and Board (comic strip)

[[This second|DATE]] "[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board|alias_match_article_entity]]" was discontinued on [[November 29, 1958|DATE]].

[[Gene Ahern|Ahern|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s "[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board|alias_match_article_entity]]" had no connection with [[Bostwick|PERSON]]'s strip other than the similar title.

Leaving [[Newspaper Enterprise Association|NEA|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[March 1936|DATE]] for [[King Features Syndicate|King Features|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Gene Ahern|Ahern|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] created a copycat strip, using the title of the previous [[King Features Syndicate|King Features|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] strip, [[Bostwick|PERSON]]'s "[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board|alias_match_article_entity]]".

The new "[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board|alias_match_article_entity]]" had more than a few parallels with "[[Our Boarding House|Our Boarding House|alias_match_match_candidate]]", including a larger-than-life blowhard as the central character.

As a consequence, "The Squirrel Cage" and "[[Our Boarding House|Our Boarding House|alias_match_match_candidate]]" are [[today|DATE]] both better remembered than "[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board|alias_match_article_entity]]", despite its [[17-year|DURATION]] run.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|His|PERSON_coref]] origins were as a company director in the foundry industry in [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|annotation]], which led [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] into conflict with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party|annotation]] when it proposed to nationalise the iron and steel industries; profoundly unable to support [[Labour Party (UK)|the party|non_person_coref]], [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] crossed the floor and became an active [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party|annotation]] supporter.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]' father [[Thomas|PERSON]] was from [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|annotation]] and [[Thomas|he|PERSON_coref]] was brought up in [[Middlesbrough|the town|non_person_coref]].

In [[1931|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party|annotation]], and [[the next year|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] was elected to [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|alias_match_match_candidate]] Town Council.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] was chosen as [[Labour Party (UK)|the party|non_person_coref]]'s candidate for [[Middlesbrough East (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough East|annotation]], and in the [[1935|DATE]] general election [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] fought a tense three-way contest against the sitting [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party|annotation]] [[Member of parliament|Member|alias_match_single_candidate]] and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party|annotation]] challenger.

In the event the sitting [[Member of parliament|Member|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s vote collapsed, and [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was elected with a tiny majority of [[67|NUMBER]] over the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative candidate|alias_match_single_candidate]].

Edwards began [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Member of parliament|Parliamentary|alias_match_single_candidate]] career by moving a motion calling for the location of industry to be planned, in which [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] called for an area of [[40|NUMBER]] miles around [[London|London|annotation]] to be closed to new industry.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] was concerned about a government proposal to help the iron and steel industry in [[Jarrow|Jarrow|annotation]], arguing that it would become a competitor to [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] own constituency.

In [[April 1937|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] opposed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative government|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s proposal for assistance to 'special areas', complaining that it had the deliberate intention of depriving [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|alias_match_match_candidate]] of the advantages other areas were to have.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] made a failed attempt to get [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|alias_match_match_candidate]] included during the passage of the Bill, in which [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] was joined by the [[Middlesbrough West (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough West|annotation]] [[Member of parliament|MP|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[F. Kingsley Griffith|Frank Kingsley Griffith|annotation]].

In [[1937|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] took up the issue of producing oil from coal, and claimed that the [[Falmouth Committee|ORGANIZATION]] looking into the question had deliberately restricted its remit and sent an insulting letter to a company which might have helped it.

[[Early in 1939|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] protested against criticism of the police voiced in [[Member of parliament|Parliament|alias_match_single_candidate]] by [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party of Great Britain|annotation]] [[Member of parliament|MP|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Willie Gallacher (politician)|Willie Gallacher|annotation]].

In [[1941|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] proposed that all import duties be abolished, and in [[December the same year|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] made a speech deploring the low rate of production placing the blame on the [[HM Treasury|Treasury|annotation]]'s "throttling hands".

At the [[time|DATE]] when Sir [[Oswald Mosley|Oswald Mosley|annotation]] was released from detention due to ill health, [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] put down a question to ask how long it would take for [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] to get better before [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] return to prison.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] called for [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]]-time coalition government to be broken up in [[January 1944|DATE]], so that [[United States|the country|non_person_coref]] could benefit from "organized opposition".

[[The Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] issue of housing rebuilding concerned [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]], and in [[September 1944|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] announced a scheme for a garden city to be built on the outskirts of [[Guisborough|Guisborough|annotation]].

Re-elected in the [[1945|DATE]] general election with a majority of [[8,075|NUMBER]], [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] raised the plight of some new [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] who were unable to find anywhere to stay in [[London|London|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had been a critic of the Excess Profits Tax during [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]], and called for its abolition after the end of [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]], a campaign [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] continued despite Government resistance.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|His|PERSON_coref]] faith as a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist|annotation]], which was said to be "unshakable", led [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] to get involved in a prolonged dispute over whether [[Christian Science|Christian Science|alias_match_match_candidate]] 'nurses' should be able to use that title despite not being [[State Registered Nurses|ORGANIZATION]].

In [[1945|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] strongly opposed [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative MP|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Hugh Linstead|Hugh Linstead|annotation]]'s motion to prevent them doing so, arguing that the [[Christian Science|Christian Science|alias_match_match_candidate]] nurses did not compete with other nurses.

[[Labour Party (UK)|The Labour Party|alias_match_single_candidate]] called [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] before a board of the [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee|annotation]] to explain himself, and [[Labour Party (UK)|the party|non_person_coref]] General Secretary [[Morgan Phillips|Morgan Phillips|annotation]] wrote to [[Morgan Phillips|him|PERSON_coref]] asking for a written undertaking about [[Morgan Phillips|his|PERSON_coref]] [[future|DATE]] political conduct.

In [[August 1949|DATE]], after [[Aneurin Bevan|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Member of parliament|Parliamentary|alias_match_single_candidate]] campaign against the [[Iron and Steel Act 1949|Steel Bill|annotation]] had proved unsuccessful, [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] announced that [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] had joined the [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Association|alias_match_single_candidate]] and applied for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party|alias_match_single_candidate]] whip in [[Member of parliament|Parliament|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] was immediately adopted as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative candidate|alias_match_single_candidate]] for [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] constituency, and made a speech praising private enterprise and denouncing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] extremism.

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|He|PERSON_coref]] experienced a turbulent campaign during the [[1950|DATE]] general election, at which [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] made steel nationalisation the main issue.

"[[The Times|The Times|annotation]]" commented that "[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] meetings in [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] wards have the painful atmosphere of lessons in which the master is unteaching [[the last few years|DURATION]]' work in [[one|NUMBER]] short period to a class unhampered by politeness".

In the end, [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] lost [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|his|PERSON_coref]] seat by [[16,783|NUMBER]] votes to [[Hilary Marquand|Hilary Marquand|annotation]], the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Minister of Pensions|annotation]] who had moved from [[Hilary Marquand|his|PERSON_coref]] previous seat in [[Cardiff East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff East|annotation]].

[[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was then picked as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party|alias_match_single_candidate]] candidate for [[Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-upon-Tyne East|annotation]], which was still [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] held but more marginal.

When steel nationalisation took effect, [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|he|PERSON_coref]] was compelled to resign from the board of [[Gjers, Mills and Co. Ltd.|ORGANIZATION]], of Ayresome Ironworks [[Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough|alias_match_match_candidate]], when the Iron and [[Steel Corporation|ORGANIZATION]] informed [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|him|PERSON_coref]] of a policy that only executive directors should hold office in nationalised companies.

In [[March 1953|DATE]] [[Alfred Edwards (politician)|Edwards|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] was adopted as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative candidate|alias_match_single_candidate]] for [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin|annotation]], a [[Shropshire|Shropshire|annotation]] division where [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] had a majority of [[1,804|NUMBER]].

Whad'Ya Know?

Feldman often comments that the "[[Whad'Ya Know?|Whad'Ya Know|alias_match_article_entity]]" quiz is not a trivia quiz, but rather [

" When [[Whad'Ya Know?|the show|non_person_coref]] is recorded from its home base at [[Monona Terrace|Mon

Twice during [[Whad'Ya Know?|the show|non_person_coref]], usually towards the end of [[each hour|SET]], the "Whad'ya Know" quiz is played.

If a team earns [[three|NUMBER]] points without missing a single question, they have the option of going for the "[[Mother lode|Mother Lode|annotation]]" by answering [[two|NUMBER]] more questions correctly without missing [[one|NUMBER]], or else a fictitious penalty is put upon them (usually made up on the spot by the announcer and related to a joke from earlier in [[Whad'Ya Know?|the show|non_person_coref]]).

Along with the [[Whad'Ya Know?|Whad'Ya Know|alias_match_article_entity]] Quiz, music from the [[Whad'Ya Know?|Whad'Ya Know|alias_match_article_entity]] Trio (often new arrangements or original compositions), and interviews with both celebrities and audience members, other segments have become recurring staples to [[Whad'Ya Know?|the show|non_person_coref]]'s format.

The Giving Tree

[[Shel Silverstein|Silverstein|alias_match_single_candidate]] had difficulty finding a publisher for "[[The Giving Tree|The Giving Tree|alias_match_article_entity]]".

An editor at [[Simon & Schuster|Simon & Schuster|annotation]] rejected [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]]'s manuscript because [[Shel Silverstein|he|PERSON_coref]] felt that it was "too sad" for children and "too simple" for adults.

[[Harper & Row|ORGANIZATION]] published a small [[first|ORDINAL]] edition of [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]], consisting of only [[5,000|NUMBER]]–[[7,500|NUMBER]] copies, in [[1964|DATE]].

[[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] follows the lives of an apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with [[one|NUMBER]] another.

Interest in [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] increased by word of mouth; for example, in churches "it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving."

As of [[2001|DATE]], over [[5 million|NUMBER]] copies of [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] had been sold, placing it [[14th|ORDINAL]] on a list of hardcover "All-Time Bestselling Children's Books" from "[[Publishers Weekly|Publishers Weekly|annotation]]."

By [[2011|DATE]], [[8.5 million|NUMBER]] copies of [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] had been sold.

In a [[1999|DATE]]–[[2000|DATE]] [[National Education Association|National Education Association|annotation]] online survey of children, among the "Kids' Top [[100|NUMBER]] Books," [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] was [[24th|ORDINAL]].

In the [[2007|DATE]] online "Teachers' Top [[100|NUMBER]] Books for Children" poll by the [[National Education Association|National Education Association|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] came in [[third|ORDINAL]].

There are numerous interpretations of [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]], including:

[[Ursula Nordstrom|Ursula Nordstrom|alias_match_match_candidate]] attributed [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]]'s success partially to "Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers", who believed that the tree represents "the Christian ideal of unconditional love."

[[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] has been used to teach children environmental ethics.

An educational resource for children describes [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] as an "allegory about the responsibilities a human being has for living organisms in the environment," [[Lisa Rowe Fraustino|PERSON]] states that “some curricula use [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] as a what-not-to-do role model."

UMBER]] of friendship. As such, [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] teaches children "as your life becomes polluted with the trappings of the modern world — as you 'grow up' — your relationships tend to suffer if you let them

A common interpretation of [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] is that the tree and the boy have a parent–child relationship, as in a [[1995|DATE]] collection of essays about [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] edited by [[Richard John Neuhaus|Richard John Neuhaus|annotation]] in the journal "[[First Things|First Things|annotation]]".

Among the essayists, some were positive about the relationship; for example, [[Amy Kass|Amy A. Kass|annotation]] wrote about the story that "it is wise and it is true about giving and about motherhood," and [[Lisa Rowe Fraustino|her|PERSON_coref]] husband [[Leon Kass|Leon R. Kass|annotation]] encourages people to read [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] because the tree "is an emblem of the sacred memory of our own mother's love."

[[Mary Ann Glendon|Mary Ann Glendon|annotation]] wrote that [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] is "a nursery tale for the 'me' generation, a primer of narcissism, a catechism of exploitation," and [[Jean Bethke Elshtain|Jean Bethke Elshtain|annotation]] felt that the story ends with the tree and the boy "both wrecks."

A [[1998|DATE]] study using phenomenographic methods found that Swedish children and mothers tended to interpret [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] as dealing with friendship, while Japanese mothers tended to interpret [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] as dealing with parent–child relationships.

Some authors believe that [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] is not actually intended for children, but instead should be treated as a satire aimed at adults along the lines of "[[A Modest Proposal|A Modest Proposal|annotation]]" by [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift|annotation]].

In an interview with "Horn Book Magazine", [[Phyllis J. Fogelman|PERSON]], an editor with [[Harper & Row|ORGANIZATION]], said [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] is "about a sadomasochistic relationship" and "elevates masochism to the level of a good", which mirrors [[Mary Daly|Mary Daly|annotation]]'s analysis in "[[Mary Daly|Gyn/Ecology|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]: the Metaethics of Radical Feminism".

[[One|NUMBER]] college instructor discovered that [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] caused both male and female remedial reading students to be angry because they felt that the boy exploited the tree.

For teaching purposes, [[Jonathan Swift|he|PERSON_coref]] paired [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] with a short story by [[Andre Dubus|Andre Dubus|annotation]] entitled "The Fat Girl" because its plot can be described as "[[The Giving Tree|The Giving Tree|alias_match_article_entity]]" "in reverse."

Some readers may interpret [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] against the wider background of [[Shel Silverstein|Silverstein|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s interactions with women, e.g., that [[Shel Silverstein|he|PERSON_coref]] frequented the [[Playboy Mansion|Playboy Mansion|annotation]] and [[Playboy Club|Playboy Club|annotation]]s, and allegedly, according to [[Shel Silverstein|his|PERSON_coref]] biography "A Boy Named Shel", slept with hundreds, perhaps thousands of women.

The photograph of [[Shel Silverstein|Silverstein|alias_match_single_candidate]] on the back cover of [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]] has attracted attention.

In the cartoon, a nude woman cuts off a nude man's arms and legs with scissors, then sits on [[Shel Silverstein|his|PERSON_coref]] torso in a pose similar to the final drawing in "[[The Giving Tree|The Giving Tree|alias_match_article_entity]]" in which the old man sits on the stump.

Jackson and [[Dell|ORGANIZATION]] ([[1979|DATE]]) wrote an "alternative version" of the story for teaching purposes that was entitled "The Other [[The Giving Tree|Giving Tree|alias_match_article_entity]]."

Playwright [[Topher Payne|PERSON]] ([[2019|DATE]]) wrote an alternate ending for [[The Giving Tree|the book|non_person_coref]], "The Tree Who Set Healthy Boundaries", as part of the "Topher Fixed It" seri

Chatterer

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|annotation]] is a fictional character appearing in the "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|annotation]]" film series.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] has become a fan favourite character in the "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" franchise.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] is a member of the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites|alias_match_single_candidate]], formerly-human monsters dedicated to exploring the limits of human sensation; these "explorations" take the form of extreme sadomasochism, to the point that it is considered torture by most of those whom they encounter.

Like [[His|his|PERSON_coref]] fellow [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] has lost all memory of [[His|his|PERSON_coref]] life as a human before [[His|he|PERSON_coref]] became a [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]]; "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]: Hellbound" indicates that [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] opened the box while still a young boy.

A short story written by actor [[Nicholas Vince|PERSON]], who played [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] in the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[two|NUMBER]] "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" films, offers an origin for the version of [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] who appears in "[[The Hellbound Heart|The Hellbound Heart|alias_match_match_candidate]]".

Vince's story, "Look See", claimed that the novella version of [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] was a handsome young actor who specialized in off-color humor.

A hugely successful, albeit corrupt, actor (who among other things slept with underage women and framed rival actors and [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] enemies for being communists in order to ruin their careers), [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] eventually found the box and sensing [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] dark heart, mutilated [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] face to match [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] inner self and as [[Nicholas Vince|he|PERSON_coref]] was brought into the Order of the Gash.

Like [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] fellow [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]'s body has been subjected to an extreme form of body modification and ritual scarification; in [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]'s case, [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] face has been severely disfigured and [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] lips have been peeled back to permanently expose [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] teeth, which [[Nicholas Vince|he|PERSON_coref]] can only click together as a means of communication.

As [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Nicholas Vince|Vince|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wore a one-piece mask that rendered [[Nicholas Vince|him|PERSON_coref]] blind.

The design was changed in the sequel to give [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] eyes so [[Nicholas Vince|Vince|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] could see.

Due to the original version of the character's death by Dr. [[Phillip Channard|PERSON]] at the end of "[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II|Hellbound: Hellraiser II|annotation]]", as well as the characters absence from the sequel "[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|annotation]]", several alternate versions of the [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] character were devised to appear in the numerous sequels in the "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" franchise.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] II was intended to be a redesign of the original [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] character in "[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II|Hellbound: Hellraiser II|annotation]]", with the updated version of the character allowing [[Nicholas Vince|Nicholas Vince|alias_match_match_candidate]] to be able to see through the makeup effects after an injury the actor sustained on set.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] III [[first|ORDINAL]] appeared in "[[Hellraiser: Hellseeker|Hellraiser: Hellseeker|annotation]]" portrayed by [[Mike Jay Regan|PERSON]].

[[Hellraiser|The Female|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]], otherwise known as [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] [[IV|NUMBER]] or [[Hellraiser|Female Cenobite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] [[Hellbound: Hellraiser II|II|NUMBER_part_of_seen_entity]], is an amalgam of [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] and the [[Hellraiser|Female Cenobite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] that appears in "[[Hellraiser: Revelations|Hellraiser: Revelations|annotation]]" portrayed by [[Jolene Anderson|PERSON]].

Torso is a [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]'s likeness that appears in "[[Hellraiser: Inferno|Hellraiser: Inferno|annotation]]".

Torso is portrayed by [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] III actor [[Mike Jay Regan|PERSON]], and, as [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] name suggests, has the lower half of [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] body missing.

This [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]] was reportedly created by the original [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] himself.

The [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] Beast appears as [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s pet in "[[Hellraiser: Bloodline|Hellraiser: Bloodline|annotation]]".

The [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] Beast was moulded from human flesh by the Leviathan and designed to be [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s pet in [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]'s image.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[first|ORDINAL]] introduced in the novella "[[The Hellbound Heart|The Hellbound Heart|annotation]]".

Along with the other [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] takes antagonist Frank Cotton back to the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]] realm after Cotton opens the [[The Hellbound Heart|Lament Configuration|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], expecting to find a hedonistic paradise that will cure [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] nihilism.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] is later part of the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]] contingent that makes a deal with [[Frank|PERSON]]'s niece, [[Kirsty|PERSON]], to return Frank to them in exchange for [[Kirsty|her|PERSON_coref]] own freedom, after [[Kirsty|she|PERSON_coref]] unwittingly makes a deal to return to the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]] realm by opening the box.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] would reappear in the film adaptation of "[[The Hellbound Heart|The Hellbound Heart|alias_match_match_candidate]]", "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]", in which [[Frank|he|PERSON_coref]] was given a name in the film's closing credits.

Unlike in the novella, this [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] is completely mute, only capable of communicating by clicking [[Frank|his|PERSON_coref]] teeth together.

In "Hellbound", [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] is renamed "[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] II" following aesthetic modifications to the mutilations on [[Frank|his|PERSON_coref]] face.

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]], along with the rest of the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites|alias_match_single_candidate]], are killed by Channard following a short fight; like the other [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] reverts to a non-mutilated human form after [[Frank|he|PERSON_coref]] dies – the form of a teenage boy.

Unlike the other members of [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s entourage from the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[two|NUMBER]] "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" films, [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] has made appearances in later entries in the series.

The only films in which [[Frank|he|PERSON_coref]] does not appear are "[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|annotation]]" and "[[Hellraiser: Bloodline|Hellraiser: Bloodline|annotation]]", the latter of which features a dog-like creature with [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]'s head called "The Chatter Beast".

The latest entry in the series "[[Hellraiser: Revelations|Hellraiser: Revelations|annotation]]" features a cenobite identical to [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] except that it has a pair of visible breasts; this [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite|alias_match_single_candidate]] has been alternately identified as "[[Hellraiser|Female Cenobite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]."

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] has most [[recently|DATE]] appeared in [[Clive Barker|Clive Barker|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" comic book series for "BOOM!"

After "pleading" with [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead|alias_match_single_candidate]] (in the form of clicking [[Clive Barker|his|PERSON_coref]] teeth), [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] is torn apart by a series of hooked chains.

The [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]'s origin was revealed in the [[2017|DATE]] short story "Prayers for Desire" written by [[Nicholas Vince|Nicholas Vince|alias_match_match_candidate]] and illustrated by [[Clive Barker|Clive Barker|alias_match_match_candidate]], published by Seraphim Incorporated in the graphic novel "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]] Anthology Volume [[2|NUMBER]]".

[[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] was played by [[Nicholas Vince|Nicholas Vince|annotation]] in "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|annotation]]" and "[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II|Hellbound: Hellraiser II|annotation]]".

Vince suffered an injury to [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] jaw during filming of "Hellbound" during a scene where [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] was to be impaled with several hooks.

Due to this injury, [[Nicholas Vince|Vince|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] requested that [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] be given eyes to help with [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] vision.

Torso from "[[Hellraiser: Inferno|Hellraiser: Inferno|annotation]]", and the [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] in "[[Hellraiser: Hellseeker|Hellraiser: Hellseeker|annotation]]", "[[Hellraiser: Deader|Hellraiser: Deader|annotation]]", "[[Hellraiser: Hellworld|Hellraiser: Hellworld|annotation]]" and "[[Hellraiser: Judgment|Hellraiser: Judgment|annotation]]" were all performed by [[Mike Jay Regan|PERSON]].

The female [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] that appeared in "[[Hellraiser: Revelations|Hellraiser: Revelations|annotation]]" was portrayed by [[Jolene Andersen|PERSON]].

Shock Till You Drop called [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] an iconic character that is "simply a badass and incredibly terrifying".

In [[Nicholas Vince|his|PERSON_coref]] review of the original "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" film, [[Chris Stuckmann|Chris Stuckmann|annotation]] stated when talking about how little screentime [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead|annotation]] actually has in the film, "In fact I was more scared by The [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]], who must have inspired the creative team behind "[[Silent Hill|Silent Hill|annotation]]".

Ironically, the figure claims to be from "[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth|annotation]]", which is [[one|NUMBER]] of the few films in the "[[Hellraiser|Hellraiser|alias_match_match_candidate]]" franchise in which [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]] (or any version of [[Chatterer|Chatterer|alias_match_article_entity]]) does not actually appear.

Wenchang Wang

[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|annotation]], also known as [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Dijun|annotation]], is a Taoist deity in [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythology|annotation]], known as the God of Culture and Literature.

[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] is physically represented by a constellation of [[six|NUMBER]] stars near the [[Big Dipper|Big Dipper|annotation]].

[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] is often depicted as an elderly scholar accompanied by [[two|NUMBER]] attendants, Tianlong ( or Heaven-Deaf) and Diya ( or Earth-Mute).

There are quite a few accounts of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]]; most depict [[him|PERSON]] as a man by the name [[Wenchang Wang|Zhang Yazi|alias_match_article_entity]], of a county in [[Sichuan|Sichuan|annotation]] Province called [[Zitong County|Zitong|annotation]].

Other accounts of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] appear rather sporadically at different time periods; [[Fu Jian (337–385)|he|PERSON_coref]] has been given [[seventeen|NUMBER]] reincarnations over a period of [[3,000 years|DURATION]].

A notable account of an appearance of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] was as the Spirit of [[Zitong County|Zitong|alias_match_single_candidate]], during the suppression of a rebellion in [[Chengdu|Chengdu|annotation]], [[Sichuan|Sichuan|alias_match_match_candidate]], in [[1000 A.D|DATE]].

In addition to being a respected warrior, [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] was well respected as a model for filiality.

The "Book of Emperor Zi Tong" records: "[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] was had a mature mind at birth.

In the middle of the [[night|TIME]], [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] cut flesh from [[Fu Jian (337–385)|his|PERSON_coref]] own thighs and fed it to [[Fu Jian (337–385)|his|PERSON_coref]] mother.

[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] also appears in other texts, where [[Fu Jian (337–385)|he|PERSON_coref]] is praised for other noble virtues.

The book "[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] Emperor and the States [[Fu Jian (337–385)|He|PERSON_coref]] Stabilized" states: "[[Fu Jian (337–385)|He|PERSON_coref]] descended into the mortal world [[seventy-three|NUMBER]] times as a "shidafu"" (a scholar-bureaucrat position in the emperor's government of feudal [[China|China|alias_match_popular_entity]]).

[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] was uncorrupted, upright and just, and never dealt out harsh punishments to the people.

There is controversy over the actual position of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]], despite common practice of attributing [[Fu Jian (337–385)|him|PERSON_coref]] to [[Wenchang Wang|Zhang Yazi|alias_match_article_entity]].

Many point out that the stories on [[Wenchang Wang|Zhang Yazi|alias_match_article_entity]] are attributed mainly to honor and heroism, having nothing to do with actual literature.

In [[Fu Jian (337–385)|his|PERSON_coref]] "Myths and Legends of [[China|China|alias_match_popular_entity]]", E.T.C. [[Werner|PERSON]] points out that "Wherever [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] is worshiped there will also be found a separate representation of [[Kui Xing|Kui Xing|annotation]], showing that while the official deity has been allowed to 'borrow glory' from the popular god, and even to assume [[Werner|his|PERSON_coref]] personality, the independent existence of the stellar spirit is nevertheless sedulously maintained."

Initially, scholars worshiped this star, [[Kui Xing|Kui Xing|alias_match_match_candidate]], as the God of Literature, but with time, [[Werner|he|PERSON_coref]] was eventually linked to the Dipper (constellation) or Great Bear, and assimilated into [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] Jundi.

[[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] has had various titles, but was officially apotheosized by [[Yen Yu of the Mongol Dynasty|ORGANIZATION]] in [[1314 A.D|DATE]] as the Supporter of the Yuan (Mongol) [[Dynasty|LOCATION]], Diffuser of Renovating Influences, Ssu-lu of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]], God and Lord.

There are many different temples and shrines dedicated to worshiping [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]], the most notable being the [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] temple of [[Zitong County|Zitong|alias_match_single_candidate]], located at modern-day [[Qiqu Mountain|ORGANIZATION]].

This famous mountain is both the location of the largest cypress forest in [[China|China|alias_match_popular_entity]] as well as the origin of the [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] culture.

As [[Sichuan|Sichuan|alias_match_match_candidate]] (where Qiqu Mountain is located) is mainly in the south, there is a saying, "In the North there is Confucius and in the [[South|LOCATION]] there is [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]]."

There are also [[two|NUMBER]] notable temples dedicated to worshiping [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] Di Jun in [[Taichung|Taichung|LOCATION_match_candidate]]: [[one|NUMBER]] is in the [[Beitun District|Beitun|annotation]] District of [[Taichung|Taichung|annotation]], apparently construc

The practice of worshiping [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang Wang|alias_match_article_entity]] has a long history; it was popular in [[the past|DATE]] because [[Werner|he|PERSON_coref]] was allowed to be venerated by the rich and poor alike.

[[The third day of the second|DATE]] moon of the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese|alias_match_single_candidate]] lunar calendar is the birthday of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]].

People generally celebrated [[Werner|his|PERSON_coref]] birthday by visiting [[Werner|his|PERSON_coref]] temples, the officials and scholars of the county all had to go to the Temple of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchang|alias_match_article_entity]] to make offerings, sacrifices or recite poems.

Later on the legal classification of [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|the line|non_person_coref]] was changed from a tram to a light rail, however the gauge was not widened, unlike the majority of [[762|NUMBER]]mm gauge lines.

* [[Yokkaichi|Yokkaichi|alias_match_match_candidate]] Asunarou Railway: [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|Utsube Line|alias_match_article_entity]] (this line)

The [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|Utsube Line|alias_match_article_entity]] was originally conceived and built by the , later renamed Mie Railway ("Santetsu").

The original section of [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|the line|non_person_coref]] was completed in [[1912|DATE]] making it [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s oldest train lines.

Steam locomotives ran on [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|the line|non_person_coref]] for many [[years|DURATION]] until [[1928|DATE]] when gasoline-powered trains were introduced, which ran until [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|the line|non_person_coref]] was electrified in [[1943|DATE]].

The original section of [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Hachiōji Line|the line|non_person_coref]], from Suwa to the end of never-to-be-finished [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka|alias_match_single_candidate]] branch became the "[[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|Utsube Line|alias_match_article_entity]]", and the section of track which included the old terminus at Ise-Hachiōji became a branch line called the "[[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Hachiōji Line|Hachiōji Line|alias_match_single_candidate]]".

During the latter part of the Santetsu era and the entire [[Sanco|ORGANIZATION]] era, there was direct service offered between the now-separate [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|Utsube Line|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Yunoyama Line|Yunoyama Line|annotation]], which at that time was also a gauge railway; the combination of these [[two|NUMBER]] train lines was called the Mie Line.

At [[first|ORDINAL]], the direct connection with the [[Yunoyama Line|Yunoyama Line|alias_match_match_candidate]] was maintained however in [[1964|DATE]], the [[Yunoyama Line|Yunoyama Line|alias_match_match_candidate]] was altered and renovated to connect directly with the [[Nagoya Line (Kintetsu)|Nagoya Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] and thus the connection with the [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|Utsube Line|alias_match_article_entity]] was closed and direct service ended.

As a consequence, [[Yokkaichi|Yokkaichi|alias_match_match_candidate]] Asunarou Railway was incorporated and took control of [[Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line|the line|non_person_coref]] as from [[April 1, 2015|DATE]].

[[Church of Scotland|Scottish|alias_match_single_candidate]] writer [[Roddy Martine|PERSON]] stumbled into [[Dora Noyce|Noyce|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s establishment in the early [[1970s|DATE]], though remained uninvolved: "I remember it being rather scruffy.

Because of its notoriety, neighbours in the vicinity of [[Dora Noyce|Noyce|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s brothel, managed to gain a reduction in their rates because of the impact on the value of local properties.

A [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative|annotation]] supporter who displayed banners for [[Conservative Party (UK)|the party|non_person_coref]] in [[Dora Noyce|her|PERSON_coref]] windows during elections, [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] embarrassed [[Dora Noyce|her|PERSON_coref]] member of parliament by turning up at garden fetes.

When charged, according to a former senior [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh|alias_match_match_candidate]] policeman, [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] would only admit to "doing what comes naturally" and "would simply accept it as part of the job.

[[Dora Noyce|She|PERSON_coref]] would pay the fine, keep a low profile for [[a day|DURATION]] or [[two|NUMBER]] and then" continue "as if nothing had happened".

Other accounts relate that [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] would converse with the press at [[Deacon Brodie|ORGANIZATION]]'s pub (in the [[Royal Mile|Royal Mile|annotation]]) after a court appearance.

On [[Dora Noyce|her|PERSON_coref]] release, [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] said [[Dora Noyce|her|PERSON_coref]] sentence "was very stupid of the court. I was just a burden on the ratepayers and, goodness knows, they have enough to put up with already".

[[Dora Noyce|She|PERSON_coref]] served as a police informer on occasion, which helped to reduce the number of raids, and reportedly had an "arrangement" whereby [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] would only be raided about twice [[a year|DURATION]] in exchange for information, often about stolen goods.

On [[one|NUMBER]] official visit, [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] reputedly asked: "Business or pleasure, gentlemen?"

Local councillors commented that they received more complaints when [[Dora Noyce|Noyce|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was in prison because [[Dora Noyce|her|PERSON_coref]] business was less well managed.

[[Dora Noyce|She|PERSON_coref]] became [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s characters, well known to locals, who was mourned when [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] died.

A neighbour corresponded to "[[The Scotsman|The Scotsman|annotation]]" newspaper in a letter published on [[26 August 1977|DATE]]: "I confess to having felt something of affection for [[Dora Noyce|Dora Noyce|alias_match_article_entity]].

At least [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] was prepared to accept responsibility for what occurred within and outside of [[Dora Noyce|her|PERSON_coref]] premises.

...It may well be that [[Mrs Noyce|PERSON]] was right when [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] always claimed that [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] offered a necessary social service".

The establishment finally closed not long after [[Dora Noyce|she|PERSON_coref]] died.

[[Penn Symons|William Penn Symons|alias_match_article_entity]] was born on [[17 July 1843|DATE]] at [[Hatt|LOCATION]], [[Cornwall|Cornwall|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the eldest son of [[William Symons|PERSON]] and [[Caroline Anne|PERSON]] ("née" [[Southwell|PERSON]]).

[[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was promoted to lieutenant on [[11 December 1866|DATE]] and captain on [[16 February 1878|DATE]].

[[Penn Symons|His|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] combat experience was in [[South Africa|South Africa|alias_match_popular_entity]] during the [[Ninth|ORDINAL]] Xhosa [[Second Boer War|War|alias_match_single_candidate]] ([[1877|DATE]]–[[78|NUMBER]]) where as a captain of the [[2nd Battalion|ORGANIZATION]] of the [[South Wales Borderers|24th Foot|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] faced the native [[Gcaleka|Gcaleka|annotation]] and [[Ngqika people|Ngqika|annotation]] tribes led by Chief [[Mgolombane Sandile|Mgolombane Sandile|annotation]].

[[Colonel|Colonel|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was given the staff rank of brigadier general and was to be [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding|annotation]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal|annotation]] with temporary rank of major general on [[15 May 1899|DATE]]; later that [[year on 20 September|DATE]] [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] staff rank would be raised to major general and on [[9 October|DATE]] to lieutenant general.

When [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] arrived in [[South Africa|South Africa|alias_match_popular_entity]] there were around [[ten thousand|NUMBER]] troops spread between [[Cape Colony|Cape Colony|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Penn Symons|He|PERSON_coref]] was asked by the [[War Office|War Office|annotation]] to advise on the number of troops required to safely garrison the [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal|alias_match_single_candidate]] from the threat of invasion from the [[Boer Republics|Boer Republics|annotation]] of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal|annotation]] and [[Orange Free State|Orange Free State|annotation]].

In the end the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet|annotation]] decided to send [[ten thousand|NUMBER]] extra troops but they also appointed [[Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[Sir|Sir|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[George White (British Army officer)|George White|annotation]] to supersede [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] as [[General officer commanding|GOC|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal|alias_match_single_candidate]].

However, before [[White|White|alias_match_popular_entity]] arrived at [[Cape Town|Cape Town|annotation]] [[Penn Symons|Penn Symons|alias_match_article_entity]] (who was known as a "fire eater"), had on [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] own authority deployed [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] brigades [[seventy|NUMBER]] miles north of [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith|annotation]] at a town called [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee|annotation]].

[[White|White|alias_match_popular_entity]] wanted to recall the [[Dundee|Dundee|alias_match_popular_entity]] garrison to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith|alias_match_single_candidate]] but because of political pressures from [[Sir|Sir|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[Walter Hely-Hutchinson|Walter Hely-Hutchinson|annotation]], the Governor of [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] agreed to leave them there.

[[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was annoyed by the "impudence" of the Boers to attack before breakfast.

The [[British Army|British|alias_match_single_candidate]] guns moved to return fire as the general surveyed the [[Second Boer War|Boer|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] positions and gave orders to [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] commanding officers.

Symons believed in old fashioned military tactics of close order, where by concentrating troops on the attack [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] hoped to smash the [[Second Boer War|Boer|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] defences.

The reality was that these formations were not designed to be used against long range bolt action rifles and [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]' brigades would be the [[first|ORDINAL]] of many in this war to pay the heavy cost of the mistake, as many generals would repeat it.

However, [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] orders for the cavalry commander, [[Colonel|Colonel|alias_match_popular_entity]] Möller, were less conventional, telling [[Penn Symons|him|PERSON_coref]] to act on [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] own initiative; it would be another costly mistake.

Shortly after [[9am|TIME]] [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] rode up to the wood being followed by an aide-de-camp holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled.

[[Penn Symons|He|PERSON_coref]] ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] pennant.

After a few moments [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] returned and was helped to remount [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] horse.

[[Penn Symons|He|PERSON_coref]] then rode back from the front lines until [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] was out of sight from [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] troops before [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] asked for assistance from the Indian stretcher bearers as [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] had been shot in the stomach.

In excruciating pain from a severe wound to [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] stomach, [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was taken to the [[20th Field Hospital|ORGANIZATION]] at [[Dundee|Dundee|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Despite this, all that [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] wanted to know was, "have they got the hill?"

After a few wasted [[days|DURATION]], [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]' replacement, [[Brigadier general|Brigadier General|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Yule, decided to abandon [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|the town|non_person_coref]] along with the most severely wounded to the [[Boers|LOCATION]], stealing away at [[night|TIME]] to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[The next day|DATE]], [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|the town|non_person_coref]] surrendered and thus [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] became a prisoner of war along with many others.

[[Penn Symons|He|PERSON_coref]] clearly felt betrayed by Yule and just before [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] died on [[23 October|DATE]] [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] implored the medical officer, [[Major|Major|alias_match_popular_entity]] Donegan, to "tell everyone I died facing the enemy, tell everyone I died facing the enemy".

"So [[Penn Symons|Sir Penn Symons|alias_match_article_entity]] is killed!

Well, no [[one|NUMBER]] would have laid down [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] life more gladly in such a cause.

[[Twenty years ago|DATE]] the merest chance saved [[Penn Symons|him|PERSON_coref]] from the massacre at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Islandhlwana|annotation]], and Death promoted [[Penn Symons|him|PERSON_coref]] in an [[afternoon|TIME]] from subaltern to senior captain.

Thenceforward [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] rise was rapid.

[[Penn Symons|He|PERSON_coref]] commanded the First Division of the [[Tirah campaign|Tirah Expeditionary Force|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] among the mountains with prudent skill.

[[Penn Symons|His|PERSON_coref]] brigades had no misfortunes: [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] rearguards came safely into camp.

In [[the spring of 1898|DATE]], when the army lay around [[Fort Jumrood|LOCATION]], looking forward to a fresh campaign, I used often to meet [[Penn Symons|him|PERSON_coref]].

Everyone talked of [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], of [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] energy, of [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] jokes, of [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] enthusiasm.

It was [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] who had built a racecourse on the stony plain; who had organised the [[Jumrood Spring|ORGANIZATION]] Meeting; who won the principal event himself, to the delight of the private soldiers, with whom [[Penn Symons|he|PERSON_coref]] was intensely popular; who, moreover, was to be [[first|ORDINAL]] and foremost if [[Anglo-Zulu War|the war|non_person_coref]] with the tribes broke out again; and who was entrusted with much of the negotiations with their jirgas.

Dinner with [[Penn Symons|Symons|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] in the mud tower of [[Jumrood Fort|LOCATION]] was an experience.

May the [[Orange Free State|State|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] in [[Jane Caroline|her|PERSON_coref]] necessities find others like [[Penn Symons|him|PERSON_coref]]!"

The [[Durban Light Infantry|Durban Light Infantry|annotation]] erected a memorial stone over [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] grave at [[Dundee|Dundee|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Another monument to [[Penn Symons|his|PERSON_coref]] valour was raised in [[Victoria Park|LOCATION]], [[Saltash|Saltash|annotation]], [[Cornwall|Cornwall|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Clayface

[[Clayface|Clayface|annotation]] is an alias used by several fictional supervillains appearing in [[American comic book|American comic book|annotation]]s published by [[DC Comics|DC Comics|annotation]].

In [[2009|DATE]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] was ranked as [[IGN|IGN|annotation]]'s 73rd-greatest comic book villain of all time.

A prominent enemy of [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] has appeared in various forms of non-comics media.

[[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] also appeared on the television series "[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham|annotation]]", portrayed by [[Brian McManamon|PERSON]].

Created by [[Bill Finger|Bill Finger|annotation]] and [[Bob Kane|Bob Kane|annotation]], the original [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]]) appeared in "[[Detective Comics

In the late [[1950s|DATE]], [[Batman|Batman|annotation]] began facing a series of science fiction-inspired foes, including [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]], a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by exposure to a pool of radioactive protoplasm, who became the [[second|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

In the late [[1970s|DATE]], [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]] became the [[third|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

A scientist suffering from hyperpituitarism, [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]] used the [[second|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s blood to create a cure for [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] condition, but instead became a clay-like creature that needed to pass [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] new condition on to others to survive.

Sondra Fuller of Strike Force [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra|annotation]] used the terrorist group's technology to become the [[fourth|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], also known as [[Lady Clay|LOCATION]].

[[She|PERSON]] formed the [[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]] with the original and [[third|ORDINAL]] Clayfaces.

During this era, the original [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] used the [[DNA|DNA|annotation]] of [[Payne|PERSON]] and Fuller to become the Ultimate [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] (as [[Matt Hagen|he|PERSON_coref]] [[now|DATE]] called himself).

Sometime after the [[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]] event, [[Payne|PERSON]] and Fuller had a son named Cassius "Clay" [[Payne|PERSON]], who, as the [[fifth|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], also had metahuman shapeshifting powers.

In a [[1998|DATE]] storyline, Dr. [[Peter Malloy|PERSON]] later used a sample of [[Cassius Payne|ORGANIZATION]]'s skin to become a [[Clayface|Claything|alias_match_article_entity]] when [[Peter Malloy|he|PERSON_coref]] was introduced in "[[Batman (comic book)|Batman|annotation]]" [[#550|MONEY]] ([[January 1998|DATE]]).

In [[2002|DATE]], the [[Todd Russell|PERSON]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] was introduced in "[[Catwoman|Catwoman|annotation]]" vol.

[[3|NUMBER]], [[#4|MONEY]] ([[May 2002|DATE]]), and in [[2005|DATE]], the [[Johnny Williams|PERSON]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] was introduced in "[[Batman: Gotham Knights|Batman: Gotham Knights|annotation]]" [[#60|MONEY]] ([[February 2005|DATE]]).

The original version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]], [[first|ORDINAL]] appeared in "[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics|annotation]]" [[#40|MONEY]] ([[June 1940|DATE]]).

Donning the costume of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], a villain [[Johnny Williams|he|PERSON_coref]] [[once|DATE]] played in a different movie, [[Johnny Williams|he|PERSON_coref]] begins killing the actors playing characters [[Johnny Williams|he|PERSON_coref]] killed in the order and way they die in the film, along with someone who knew [[Johnny Williams|his|PERSON_coref]] identity.

Last, [[Johnny Williams|he|PERSON_coref]] plans to murder the actor playing the [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] killer.

[[Dick Grayson|He|PERSON_coref]] [[once|DATE]] again dons the mask of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and targets [[Batman|Bruce Wayne|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s fiancée, [[Julie Madison|Julie Madison|annotation]].

In the [[Post|ORGANIZATION]]-"Crisis" continuity, [[Karlo|PERSON]] languishes in a prison hospital, when the [[current|DATE]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[Sondra Fuller|ORGANIZATION]]) visits [[Karlo|him|PERSON_coref]] out of curiosity.

[[Karlo|He|PERSON_coref]] even arranges for a small piece of the remains of [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] to be gathered to make [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] a post-mortem member of the "[[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]]", as the group called itself.

Even though the "[[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]]" is defeated, [[Karlo|PERSON]] injects himself with blood samples from [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Sondra Fuller|PERSON]], gaining the abilities to shapeshift and melt with a touch; [[Karlo|he|PERSON_coref]] becomes the self-declared "Ultimate" [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

It appears that the Ultimate [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is destroyed in this battle, but [[Karlo|he|PERSON_coref]] resurfaces as a member of the [[Villains United|Secret Society of Super Villains|annotation]].

While [[Karlo|he|PERSON_coref]] is successful in absorbing some of the heroine's powers, causing [[Sondra Fuller|her|PERSON_coref]] to regress to a teenage appearance resembling [[Donna Troy|Donna Troy|annotation]], [[Karlo|he|PERSON_coref]] is ultimately returned to normal when [[Wonder Woman|Wonder Woman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Donna Troy|Donna|alias_match_single_candidate]] were able to trick [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] into entering a train carriage with [[Wonder Woman|Wonder Woman|alias_match_match_candidate]] while [[Sondra Fuller|she|PERSON_coref]] was disguised as [[Donna Troy|Donna|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Donna Troy|Donna|alias_match_single_candidate]] subsequently using the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Truth|annotation]] to swing the carriage around and turn it into a mystical centrifuge, causing the clay [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] had taken from [[Wonder Woman|Wonder Woman|alias_match_match_candidate]] to split away from [[Karlo|him|PERSON_coref]] and re-merge with [[Wonder Woman|Wonder Woman|alias_match_match_candidate]] due to the differences between the [[two|NUMBER]] types of clay.

[[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] is among the members of the [[Injustice League|Injustice League|annotation]] and is among the villains seen in "[[Salvation Run|Salvation Run|annotation]]".

In "[[The New 52|The New 52|annotation]]" (a [[The New 52|2011 reboot|alias_match_single_candidate]] of the [[DC Comics|DC Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]] universe), as a part of the "[[Batman: Death of the Family|Death of the Family|annotation]]" storyline, [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy|alias_match_single_candidate]] breaks [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] out of [[Arkham|LOCATION]], claiming [[Sondra Fuller|she|PERSON_coref]] wants to marry [[Lex Luthor|him|PERSON_coref]].

In "[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics Annual|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[2018|DATE]]", [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]] is re-imaged as a handsome young actor who was disfigured in a car accident.

When police open fire on the vials, [[Karlo|PERSON]] is doused in the chemical and transformed into [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] attempts to evacuate the set, but [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] flings [[Karlo|him|PERSON_coref]] off into the distance and begins massacring everyone in sight.

As an added bit of revenge, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] disfigures Glory, who is working on the film as a production assistant, before [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] apprehends [[Karlo|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] patrols the sewers beneath [[Monstertown|LOCATION]], retrieving for Dr. [[October|DATE]] monsters created by leaking serum.

Dr. [[October|DATE]] offers to work on a means of returning [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] to human form permanently.

Dr. [[October|DATE]] calls the [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] persona a "fear response" that occurs [[Karlo|PERSON]]'s mind abandons empathy and embraces anger.

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] has [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] wear a high-technology forearm device (later replaced with a smaller wristband with a longer-lasting power source) that enables [[Karlo|him|PERSON_coref]] to regain human form without using [[Karlo|his|PERSON_coref]] powers—reducing the psychotic effect being [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] has on [[Karlo|PERSON]].

The device is not a cure, as the [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] [[DNA|DNA|alias_match_match_candidate]] consumes [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]]'s human [[DNA|DNA|alias_match_match_candidate]] whenever [[Karlo|he|PERSON_coref]] is locked into human form.

After pushing [[past|DATE]] the [[twelve-hour|DURATION]] mark, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] loses [[Karlo|his|PERSON_coref]] sanity and attacks Dr. [[October|DATE]].

Later, with the cure close to being finished, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is captured by Glory when the villain [[First|ORDINAL]] Victim takes over [[Arkham Asylum|LOCATION]] and releases [[Sondra Fuller|her|PERSON_coref]].

Glory removes [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s wrist controller, and [[Griffin|he|PERSON_coref]] goes insane.

As [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] rampages through [[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] to confront [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Batwoman|Batwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] obtains a weapon which can destabilize [[Karlo|PERSON]]'s molecular structure, killing [[Karlo|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Three days later|DATE]], Dr. [[October|DATE]] cures Glory [[Griffin|PERSON]], saying [[Sondra Fuller|she|PERSON_coref]] did so only for the sake of [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] did not die, however.

[[Seven|NUMBER]] issues later, in "[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#981|MONEY]], readers discover that [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] is still alive and retains [[Griffin|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] powers (at least to some degree).

In a flashback, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is among the villains that protected [[Ingrid Karlsson|PERSON]] during a riot.

The [[second|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]], [[first|ORDINAL]] appeared in "[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#298|MONEY]].

[[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] later escaped from prison and decided to investigate the protoplasmic substance that turned [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] into [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] so that [[Matt Hagen|he|PERSON_coref]] can find a way to prolong [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] powers.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] posed as wealthy civilians of [[Gotham City|Gotham City|alias_match_match_candidate]] in order to learn more about [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] criminal activities.

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_candidate]] later confronted [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] at [[Dick Grayson|his|PERSON_coref]] hideout where they used a combination of a freeze gun and the protoplasmic substance to defeat [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and return [[Dick Grayson|him|PERSON_coref]] to prison.

[[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] eventually breaks out of prison and uses the protoplasmic pool to become [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] again.

This time, [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] defeats [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] by immersing himself in the protoplasm, with the resulting battle causing [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] to destroy the cave that contained the protoplasmic pool.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] later competes with [[Joker (character)|Joker|annotation]] causing [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Batwoman|Batwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl|annotation]] to work together to defeat both villains.

After escaping from [[Green Wells Maximum Security Prison|ORGANIZATION]] upon having stashed some chemicals there, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] eventually copies the pool's protoplasmic jelly by chemistry studies, although the artificial protoplasm only allows [[Dick Grayson|him|PERSON_coref]] [[five hours|DURATION]] of [[Dick Grayson|his|PERSON_coref]] power compared to the full [[two days|DURATION]] of the pool's.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] resumes [[Dick Grayson|his|PERSON_coref]] crime spree by stealing the priceless stamp collection of millionaire [[K.A. King|PERSON]] and stealing the trophy that was to be given to [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s activities also attract the attention of [[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Assuming the form of [[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is evenly matched with [[K.A. King|him|PERSON_coref]] until [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] smashes some bleachers to provide a diversion to get away.

During [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s robbery, [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] used Kryptonite on [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]] form, only for [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] to get away by shapeshifting into a rocket.

When [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] uses [[Red Kryptonite|ORGANIZATION]] on [[K.A. King|him|PERSON_coref]], it causes [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] to go crazy.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] uses the X-Ray Vision in [[K.A. King|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]] form to see who [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] is.

Before [[K.A. King|he|PERSON_coref]] can reveal who [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] is, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s powers wear off, causing [[K.A. King|him|PERSON_coref]] to regress back to [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]].

[[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]] manages to save [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] from the [[fall|DATE]].

With [[Jimmy Olsen|Jimmy Olsen|annotation]] by [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] side, [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] works to track down [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] while [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_candidate]] works with [[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]] to catch [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac|alias_match_single_candidate]].

This leads to a team-up between [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac|alias_match_single_candidate]].

While [[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_candidate]] managed to apprehend [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] tries to escape, only for [[Dick Grayson|his|PERSON_coref]] formula to wear off which enables [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Jimmy Olsen|Jimmy Olsen|alias_match_match_candidate]] to apprehend [[Dick Grayson|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] later appears as a member of [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee|annotation]]'s [[Anti-Justice League|ORGANIZATION]] in order to capture the [[Justice League|Justice League|annotation]].

[[Matt Hagen|PERSON]]'s blood was later obtained by [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] later breaks out of prison and restores [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] powers.

Both superheroes managed to rescue [[Lois Lane|PERSON]] and defeat [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is among [[Joker (character)|the villain|non_person_coref]]s that fight [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Jason Todd|Robin|annotation]] as part of a gang of [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] foes gathered together by the [[Joker (character)|Joker|alias_match_single_candidate]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] appeared in [[Limbo|LOCATION]] alongside other dead supervillains as part of a plan to return to the living, only to be defeated by [[Hawk and Dove|Hawk and Dove|annotation]], the [[Teen Titans|Teen Titans|annotation]] and [[Jeb Stuart|PERSON]]'s [[Haunted Tank|Haunted Tank|annotation]].

During the "[[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]]" storyline, [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] gathers a small piece of [[Hagen|PERSON]]'s remains and makes [[Haunted Tank|him|PERSON_coref]] a post-mortem member of the group.

The [[third|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]], [[first|ORDINAL]] appeared at the end of "[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#477|MONEY]] before making [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] full appearance in "[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#478|MONEY]]–[[479|NUMBER]].

During this time, [[Matt Hagen|he|PERSON_coref]] sees [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] spending intimate time with [[Helena|ORGANIZATION]].

During the events of the "[[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]]" storyline, [[Sondra Fuller|PERSON]], the [[fourth|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], begins masquerading as the superheroine [[Looker (character)|Looker|annotation]] and visits [[Payne|PERSON]] at [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham|alias_match_single_candidate]].

Fuller, who is still using [[Looker (character)|Looker|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s appearance and powers, rescues [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] and influences [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] to follow [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]]'s commands.

The [[fourth|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Sondra Fuller|ORGANIZATION]] (also known as Lady Clay), [[first|ORDINAL]] appeared in "[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders|annotation]]" (vol.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] possesses identical abilities to those of [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]], but they are permanent, without the requirement for exposure to a source of protoplasm.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is defeated by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders|alias_match_single_candidate]].

Later, after the [[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]] forms and battles [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]], Fuller falls in love with [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]].

After [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]-Prime ([[Karlo|PERSON]]) is defeated, [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Sondra Fuller|PERSON]] escape and get married while on the run, and they have a child named Cassius "Clay" [[Payne|PERSON]], a play on boxer [[Muhammad Ali|Muhammad Ali|annotation]]'s birth name.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] later accompanied Black [[Adam|PERSON]] in [[Adam|his|PERSON_coref]] attack on the [[White House|White House|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]].

Before the debut appearances of the [[fifth|ORDINAL]] [[and sixth|ORDINAL]] Clayfaces, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] III and [[IV|NUMBER]] team up, breaking [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] I out of prison.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] I also futilely tries to revive [[Clayface|Clayface II|alias_match_article_entity]].

Together, the trio form the "[[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]]".

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] I later gains the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of blood samples from [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] III and [[IV|NUMBER]], becoming the "Ultimate [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]".

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] I is defeated by [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Looker (character)|Looker|annotation]] and [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] III and [[IV|NUMBER]] escape.

After the [[Clayface|Mud Pack|alias_match_article_entity]] incident, [[Payne|PERSON]] and [[Fuller|ORGANIZATION]] escape and [[fall|DATE]] in love while on the run.

They eventually have a child together named Cassius "Clay" [[Payne|PERSON]], who becomes the [[fifth|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and debuted in "[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#550|MONEY]].

If bonded with another human, it becomes a [[Clayface|Claything|alias_match_article_entity]]; the piece can give that human [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]-like abilities, such as becoming soft and malleable, being able to withstand bullets and other forms of harm, and could also manifest [[Payne|PER

When [[Hush (character)|Thomas Elliot|annotation]] attempted to give himself the shapeshifting abilities of the Clayfaces, [[Muhammad Ali|he|PERSON_coref]] determined that [[Cassius|Cassius|ORGANIZATION_human_disambiguation]] is the only 'pure' [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] in existence, as all others retain fragments of their former human [[DNA|DNA|alias_match_match_candidate]] where Cassius is the only [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] that was never anything but [[Muhammad Ali|his|PERSON_coref]] [[current|DATE]] state.

The [[sixth|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], also known as the [[Clayface|Claything|alias_match_article_entity]], also debuted in "[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#550|MONEY]].

[[Clayface|Claything|alias_match_article_entity]] is created when a skin sample from [[Cassius Payne|ORGANIZATION]] comes to life and merges with a [[Department of Extranormal Operations|D.E.O.|annotation]] scientist, Dr. [[Peter Malley|PERSON]].

[[Peter Malley|He|PERSON_coref]] has [[Clayface|the ability|non_person_coref]] to melt objects simply by looking at them.

[[Clayface|Claything|alias_match_article_entity]] is destroyed when [[Chase (comics)|Cameron Chase|annotation]] psychokinetically turns [[Peter Malley|his|PERSON_coref]] own powers against [[Peter Malley|him|PERSON_coref]], and [[Peter Malley|his|PERSON_coref]] remains are stored at the [[D.E.O. Headquarters|ORGANIZATION]].

The [[seventh|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Todd Russell|PERSON]], debuted in "[[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]]" (vol.

This version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is not named until "[[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]]" (vol.

There are very few background details given about the [[seventh|ORDINAL]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[past|DATE]].

The [[eighth|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Johnny Williams|PERSON]], debuted in "[[Batman: Gotham Knights|Batman: Gotham Knights|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[#60|MONEY]] ([[February 2005|DATE]]).

Just then, [[Johnny Williams|he|PERSON_coref]] is approached by [[Hush (character)|Hush|annotation]] and the [[Riddler|Riddler|annotation]], who tell [[Riddler|him|PERSON_coref]] that the chemicals turned [[Riddler|him|PERSON_coref]] into the latest [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

Elliot also takes some samples from [[Williams|ORGANIZATION]] to try and determine how [[Jason Todd|he|PERSON_coref]] can duplicate the shapeshifting aspects of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] without losing [[Jason Todd|his|PERSON_coref]] original form, also using these samples to infect [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s ally [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred Pennyworth|annotation]] with a virus that allows [[Hush (character)|Hush|alias_match_single_candidate]] to exert some degree of control over [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred|alias_match_single_candidate]], forcing [[Alfred Pennyworth|him|PERSON_coref]] to commit murder.

Eventually, [[Williams|PERSON]] realizes [[Alfred Pennyworth|he|PERSON_coref]] is being manipulated and [[Hush (character)|Hush|alias_match_single_candidate]] will never help [[Alfred Pennyworth|him|PERSON_coref]] after [[Hush (character)|Hush|alias_match_single_candidate]] tries to steal a sample of Cassius in the hopes that analysis of the 'pure' [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] will help [[Alfred Pennyworth|him|PERSON_coref]] crack the sample.

Each of the Clayfaces has different powers, but they all share [[Clayface|the ability|non_person_coref]] to shapeshift.

* In [[Alfred Pennyworth|his|PERSON_coref]] earliest appearances, [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] had no powers, but wore a clay mask based on [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Alfred Pennyworth|his|PERSON_coref]] movie roles.

In later comics, [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]]'s body is made out of mud upon taking the [[DNA|DNA|alias_match_match_candidate]] of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] III and [[IV|NUMBER]], enabling [[Alfred Pennyworth|him|PERSON_coref]] to gain the combined powers of both.

* [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]] originally had shapeshifting powers, yet ended up gaining [[Clayface|the ability|non_person_coref]] to dissolve people with [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] touch.

If a piece of [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] is separated from [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] mass, it can develop some consciousness of its own and even "bond" with a human to transform them into a "[[Clayface|Claything|alias_match_article_entity]]".

The [[ninth|ORDINAL]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], the [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] of [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]], debuted in "[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] Incorporated" [[#6|MONEY]] ([[June 2011|DATE]]) as part of "[[The New 52|The New 52|annotation]]" (a reboot of the [[DC Comics|DC Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]] universe).

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] tasks [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] Japan ([[Jiro Osamu|PERSON]]) to fight the [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] of [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] about [[two-and-a-half|NUMBER]] [[months|DURATION]] into [[Jiro Osamu|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Batman Incorporated|Batman Incorporated|annotation]] venture.

Not much is known about this [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], except that [[Jiro Osamu|he|PERSON_coref]] resembles all of the previous Clayfaces and seems to have their same set of powers.

Presumably, this [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], as a rival to [[Osamu|PERSON]], is a native of [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] states that this [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is a newcomer, a samurai, and operates in or around [[Hokkaido|Hokkaido|annotation]].

In "[[The New 52|The New 52|annotation]]" (a reboot of the [[DC Comics|DC Comics|alias_match_match_candidate]] universe), a villain named [[Jeffrey Bode|PERSON]] makes several short-lived clones of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

Glory [[Griffin|PERSON]] was a production assistant on the set of Second Skin [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]]'s final film.

[[Sondra Fuller|Her|PERSON_coref]] interaction with these chemicals gave [[Sondra Fuller|her|PERSON_coref]] body similar properties to those of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], though [[Sondra Fuller|she|PERSON_coref]] lacked [[Clayface|the ability|non_person_coref]] to control it.

Clownface began as a stray piece of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s body that became unattached and gained enough sentience to morph itself into a mute old man.

Later, the [[Joker (character)|Joker|alias_match_single_candidate]] infected this portion of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] with [[Joker (character)|Joker|alias_match_single_candidate]] venom, morphing it into an entirely separate killing machine [[Joker (character)|he|PERSON_coref]] called Clownface.

In "[[Batman '66|Batman '66|annotation]]" (which is based on the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s TV series|annotation]]), the [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] name was used for the true identity of False Face.

In issue [[#23|MONEY]], False Face gets [[Joker (character)|his|PERSON_coref]] hands on a shapeshifting formula that transforms [[Joker (character)|him|PERSON_coref]] into [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

The Earth-9 version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is featured in [[Tangent Comics|Tangent Comics|annotation]]' "[[Tangent Comics|Tangent: Superman's Reign|alias_match_single_candidate]]" miniseries.

In the alternate timeline of the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint|annotation]]" event, a version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is a member of [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke|annotation]]'s pirates after being broken out of a floating prison by [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke|alias_match_match_candidate]].

During attacks by [[Aquaman|Aquaman|annotation]] and [[Ocean Master|Ocean Master|annotation]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is pushed by [[Aquaman|Aquaman|alias_match_match_candidate]] into the water, apparently killing [[Deathstroke|him|PERSON_coref]].

The [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] appears in [[Year|DURATION]] [[Two|NUMBER]] of the "[[Injustice: Gods Among Us|Injustice: Gods Among Us|annotation]]" comic.

In the "[[Batman: Arkham Knight|Batman: Arkham Knight|annotation]]" prequel comic series, samples of [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]]'s mud were acquired by various parties including [[Simon Stagg|Simon Stagg|annotation]], who created "Project: Meta", and [[Hush (character)|Hush|annotation]] which [[Deathstroke|he|PERSON_coref]] used for [[Deathstroke|his|PERSON_coref]] face to hide [[Deathstroke|his|PERSON_coref]] cosmetic surgery scars.

In the [[2017|DATE]] miniseries "[[Batman: White Knight|Batman: White Knight|annotation]]", an unnamed [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] appears as a chief character.

Criminal [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier|alias_match_single_candidate]] (a version of [[Joker (character)|Joker|annotation]] who was temporarily cured of [[Joker (character)|his|PERSON_coref]] insanity after being force-fed pills by [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]) uses the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter|annotation]]'s mind control technology to control [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], while slipping small particles from [[Joker (character)|his|PERSON_coref]] body into the drinks of many of [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s other villains.

This allows [[Napier|PERSON]] to control a small army of villains via this [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s ability to control parts of [[Joker (character)|his|PERSON_coref]] body that had been separated from [[Joker (character)|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] was briefly included in the cover of [[one|NUMBER]] of the first miniseries' issues, but did not feature in the story itself.

In the [[third|ORDINAL]] miniseries, [[Joker (character)|he|PERSON_coref]] was blended with [[Joker (character)|the character|non_person_coref]] of [[Rocksteady|ORGANIZATION]], forming a [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] who was a rhinoceros in [[Joker (character)|his|PERSON_coref]] natural form.

* A character that resembles the [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] appears among the attacking criminals in the animated opening credits of the 60s "[[Batman (TV series)|Batman|annotation]]" [[Batman (TV series)|TV series|alias_match_single_candidate]], but [[Joker (character)|the villain|non_person_coref]] never actually appeared on [[Batman (TV series)|the show|non_person_coref]] itself and was instead replaced with the lesser-known, but similar-sounding, masked master of disguise called False Face portrayed by [[Malachi Throne|Malachi Throne|annotation]].

* [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] made an appearance in the [[12th|ORDINAL]] episode of the short-lived "[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey|annotation]]" [[Batman (TV series)|TV series|alias_match_single_candidate]], portrayed by [[Kirk Baltz|Kirk Baltz|annotation]].

This version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is a sculptor named [[Cassius Payne|PERSON]] who is inspired by other people's pain.

[[Joker (character)|His|PERSON_coref]] son [[Chris Cassius|PERSON]] (portrayed by [[Ian Reed Kesler|PERSON]]) can turn people into clay after stealing and taking [[Ian Reed Kesler|his|PERSON_coref]] father's formula, making [[Ian Reed Kesler|his|PERSON_coref]] powers similar to the [[Clayface|Preston Payne|alias_match_article_entity]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Ian Reed Kesler|his|PERSON_coref]] own son Cassius "Clay" [[Payne|PERSON]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] escaped from [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum|alias_match_match_candidate]] where [[Ian Reed Kesler|he|PERSON_coref]] confronted [[Ian Reed Kesler|his|PERSON_coref]] son at a gala as the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey|alias_match_single_candidate]] also show up.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] expected [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress|alias_match_single_candidate]] to kill [[Chris|PERSON]] only for [[Oracle|ORGANIZATION]] to talk [[Chris|him|PERSON_coref]] into sparing [[Chris|his|PERSON_coref]] son's life.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] then allowed himself to be arrested by the police.

* The [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] appears in "[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham|annotation]]", portrayed by [[Brian McManamon|PERSON]].

Thanks to the octopod's [[DNA|DNA|alias_match_match_candidate]] inserted in [[Hugo Strange|him|PERSON_coref]], [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]] can stretch and shape [[Hugo Strange|his|PERSON_coref]] face, making [[Hugo Strange|him|PERSON_coref]] look like anyone.

[[Hugo Strange|He|PERSON_coref]] debuts in [[Arkham Asylum|the second|non_person_coref]]-season episode "[[A Legion of Horribles|A Legion of Horribles|annotation]]", in which [[Hugo Strange|Strange|alias_match_single_candidate]] introduces [[Hugo Strange|him|PERSON_coref]] to [[James Gordon (Gotham)|Jim Gordon|annotation]], and then places [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]] in a machine that replicates [[James Gordon (Gotham)|Gordon|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s visage onto [[Hugo Strange|his|PERSON_coref]] face.

In the episode "[[Transference (Gotham)|Transference|annotation]]", [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]], disguised as [[James Gordon (Gotham)|Gordon|alias_match_single_candidate]], pulls the [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD|annotation]] off of [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham|annotation]].

However, [[Barbara Kean|PERSON]] discovers [[Gotham City Police Department|he|PERSON_coref]] is not [[James Gordon (Gotham)|Gordon|alias_match_single_candidate]] due to [[Gotham City Police Department|his|PERSON_coref]] behavior and slaps [[Gotham City Police Department|him|PERSON_coref]] in the face, deforming [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]]'s face and exposing [[Gotham City Police Department|him|PERSON_coref]] as an impostor in front of all the department.

In the episode "Nothing's Shocking," [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]] was mentioned by [[James Gordon (Gotham)|Gordon|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Bullock|PERSON]] to be behind the murders of some detectives only to discover that it was actually [[Jane Doe (character)|Jane Cartwright|annotation]].

* The [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] of Earth-99 was mentioned by that [[Earth|Earth|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]]'s [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[The CW|The CW|annotation]] crossover event, "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths|annotation]]" as having been turned into a puddle.

* The [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] made [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] animated appearance in [[Filmation|Filmation|annotation]]'s [[1970s|DATE]] [[Batman (TV series)|TV series|alias_match_single_candidate]] "[[The New Adventures of Batman|The New Adventures of Batman|annotation]]", voiced by [[Lou Scheimer|Lou Scheimer|annotation]] and later by [[Lennie Weinrib|Lennie Weinrib|annotation]].

This version must apply [[Lennie Weinrib|his|PERSON_coref]] special potion daily to keep [[Lennie Weinrib|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] powers.

In "Dead Ringers", [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], in [[Lennie Weinrib|his|PERSON_coref]] true form of [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]], forces former criminal-turned-acrobat [[Kit Martin|ORGANIZATION]] to help [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] in exchange for not telling [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] boss of [[Matt Hagen|his|PERSON_coref]] criminal record.

The plot involves posing as [[Batman|Batman|annotation]] in order to kidnap the Arabian Oil Minister [[Clayface|Basil|alias_match_article_entity]] Oram.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] later calls [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon|annotation]], stating that [[Dick Grayson|he|PERSON_coref]] will return [[Oram|PERSON]] and the blueprints for an oil-finding device in exchange for [[$10 million|MONEY]] by [[the end of the first hour|DURATION]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] then orchestrates a car accident that knocks out [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and then stows away in the [[Batmobile|Batmobile|annotation]] in order to infiltrate the [[Batcave|Batcave|annotation]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] then discovers that [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] has amnesia and uses this advantage to find out [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s secret identity, but [[Dick Grayson|his|PERSON_coref]] plan is foiled when [[Bat-Mite|Bat-Mite|annotation]] distracts [[Dick Grayson|him|PERSON_coref]] long enough for the Bat-Computer to create an antidote for [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s amnesia.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] sneaks out of the [[Batcave|Batcave|alias_match_match_candidate]] disguised as a rabbit with [[Bat-Mite|Bat-Mite|alias_match_match_candidate]] in pursuit while [[Dick Grayson|Robin|annotation]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl|annotation]] learn why Kit is involved with [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s kidnapping plot.

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] used the Bat-Boat to pursue [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] when [[Dick Grayson|he|PERSON_coref]] escapes into the water in the form of a dolphin.

After Kit returns the blueprints to [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] learn from Kit that [[Dick Grayson|he|PERSON_coref]] was to deliver a 'medicine' to [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] before [[midnight|TIME]].

When [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s shapeshifting wears off, [[Dick Grayson|he|PERSON_coref]] reverts to [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] and begins to drown as [[Hagen|PERSON]] cannot swim, until [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] saves [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] and hands [[Matt Hagen|him|PERSON_coref]] over to the police.

Oiled Again", [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] collaborates with [[Catwoman|Catwoman|annotation]] to steal a shipment of oil bound for [[Gotham City|Gotham City|annotation]] during a cold snap.

When [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] scout out each of the storage tanks in the south side and the waterfront, [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] finds [[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] at the oil storage tanks on the waterfront and is led into a trap where [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] attacks [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] in the form of a snake.

[[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] appears and shows [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] how [[Ethel Peabody|she|PERSON_coref]] and [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] have been draining the oil from [[Gotham City|Gotham City|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] breaks free from [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] when [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]], [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] and [[Bat-Mite|Bat-Mite|alias_match_match_candidate]] arrive.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] turns into an eagle to get [[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] away from [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] manage to lose [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]], [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] and [[Bat-Mite|Bat-Mite|alias_match_match_candidate]] in a car chase when the Kitty Car jumps over [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl|alias_match_single_line_candidate]].

[[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] intercept a call between [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] revolving around the oil supertanker arriving in [[Gotham City|Gotham City|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] manage to steal some of the oil and escape in their submarine as [[Catwoman|Catwoman|alias_match_match_candidate]] flees in [[Ethel Peabody|her|PERSON_coref]] plane.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] turns into a whale in order to attack [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]].

* The [[DC Animated Universe|DC animated universe|annotation]] featured the [[Matt Hagen|PERSON]] version of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], voiced by [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe|annotation]] winner [[Ron Perlman|Ron Perlman|annotation]].

The overdose saturates every cell in [[Hagen|PERSON]]'s body, turning [[Lucius Fox|him|PERSON_coref]] into the bulky and misshapen clay-like form of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] tries to get revenge on [[Daggett|PERSON]], but [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] stops [[Lucius Fox|him|PERSON_coref]] by overwhelming [[Lucius Fox|his|PERSON_coref]] powers with images of [[Lucius Fox|his|PERSON_coref]] [[past|DATE]] film roles.

When caught, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] fakes [[Lucius Fox|his|PERSON_coref]] death (with the body in the morgue turning out to be a hollow shell which dries up and breaks apart) and sneaks away in the form of a woman.

The episode "Mudslide" shows [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] reappearing and revealing that [[Lucius Fox|his|PERSON_coref]] body is beginning to deteriorate.

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] tracks [[Lucius Fox|him|PERSON_coref]] down and prevents [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s treatment.

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] then fight on a cliff during a rainstorm above an ocean.

[[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] attempts to save [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]], but [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s body absorbs too much rain to hold itself up and [[Lucius Fox|he|PERSON_coref]] falls into the ocean, where [[Lucius Fox|he|PERSON_coref]] dissolves.

** [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] returns in "[[The New Batman Adventures|The New Batman Adventures|annotation]]".

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] makes a brief appearance in the pilot episode "Holiday Knights", where [[Lucius Fox|he|PERSON_coref]] takes the form of several little boys to steal items during a [[Christmas Eve|Christmas Eve|annotation]] rush.

The episode "Growing Pains" reveals that after falling into the ocean during the events of "Mudslide", [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]]'s remains drift near a pipe leaking strange chemicals into the ocean, restoring [[Lucius Fox|his|PERSON_coref]] strength.

Still weakened, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] sends a portion of himself which takes the form of a little girl named [[Annie|PERSON]] (voiced by [[Francesca Marie Smith|PERSON]]) to see if it safe for [[Lucius Fox|him|PERSON_coref]] to resurface.

As [[Tim Drake|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] develops an affection for [[Annie|PERSON]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] poses as the girl's abusive father, committing various robberies in order to make a living in [[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]'s sewers.

Eventually, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] recovers, cornering [[Tim Drake|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] and [[Annie|PERSON]]; the latter allows herself to be reabsorbed—effectively killing [[Annie|her|PERSON_coref]]—in order to save [[Tim Drake|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]].

Enraged by [[Annie|PERSON]]'s 'death', [[Tim Drake|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] almost kills [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] with gallons of solvent, but [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]] intervenes and stops [[Tim Drake|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is then arrested and imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum|annotation]].

When [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon|annotation]] lists the charges [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is accused of, [[Tim Drake|Robin|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] quietly adds murder as [[one|NUMBER]] of them.

The [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society|annotation]] free [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] and offer [[Tim Drake|him|PERSON_coref]] membership.

[[Now|DATE]] less aggressive and psychopathic than before, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is reluctant at [[first|ORDINAL]] as [[Tim Drake|he|PERSON_coref]] just wants to be human again.

During [[Batman (TV series)|the show|non_person_coref]]down at [[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Stadium, [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] is defeated along with the rest of the group after [[Wally West|Flash|annotation]] and [[Hawkgirl|Hawkgirl|annotation]] stuff [[Tim Drake|him|PERSON_coref]] with fireworks and set them off.

* There are [[two|NUMBER]] versions of [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] that appear on "[[The Batman|The Batman|annotation]]" cartoon series: original character [[Clayface|Ethan Bennett|alias_match_article_entity]] (voiced by [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris|annotation]]), and [[Clayface|Basil Karlo|alias_match_article_entity]] (voiced by [[Wallace Langham|Wallace Langham|annotation]] in "Clayfaces", [[Lex Lang|Lex Lang|annotation]] in "[[The Batman|The Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]]/[[Superman|Superman|alias_match_match_candidate]] Story").

However, [[Ethan|he|PERSON_coref]] turns into [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] when [[Ethan|he|PERSON_coref]] inhales a dose of the [[Joker (character)|Joker|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s "[[Joker (character)|Joker|alias_match_single_candidate]] Putty."

While trying to murder [[Rojas|PERSON]], [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]] confronts Yin and [[Batman|Batman|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In season [[two|NUMBER]], [[Bennett|PERSON]] appears primarily as [[Clayface|Clayface|alias_match_article_entity]].

Tadashi Hamada

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi Hamada|annotation]] is a fictional character who appears in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Animation Studios|annotation]]' [[54th|ORDINAL]] animated feature, "[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6|annotation]]".

In addition, [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] is ethnically [[Japanese people|Japanese|annotation]] but also half Caucasian.

In [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]], a student at the [[Big Hero 6 (film)|San Fransokyo|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Institute of Technology, is the creator of [[Baymax|Baymax|annotation]], and the older brother of [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro Hamada|annotation]].

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] appears in "[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]" as [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro Hamada|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s older brother.

Due to their parents being deceased, [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s primary voice of reason and father figure.

In [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] live in [[Big Hero 6 (film)|San Fransokyo|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] with their aunt [[Cass|PERSON]].

Although [[Daniel Henney|his|PERSON_coref]] age is not explicitly described in [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] acts very mature for [[Daniel Henney|his|PERSON_coref]] age.

Additionally, [[Daniel Henney|Henney|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] describes the character as "pure", even comparing [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] to an angel.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] is also a "tech-wizard" who attends the [[Big Hero 6 (film)|San Fransokyo|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Institute of Technology, where [[Daniel Henney|he|PERSON_coref]] conceives, builds and programs [[Baymax|Baymax|annotation]].

In [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] suggests that [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] should attend the [[Big Hero 6 (film)|San Fransokyo|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Institute of Technology as [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] is also gifted in robotics and engineering, even more so than [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Daniel Henney|his|PERSON_coref]] intellect allowing [[Daniel Henney|him|PERSON_coref]] to graduate from high school at [[13|NUMBER]].

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] responds to this by redirecting [[Daniel Henney|his|PERSON_coref]] little brother's intelligence, taking [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] with [[Daniel Henney|him|PERSON_coref]] on a quick trip to [[Daniel Henney|his|PERSON_coref]] college.

From it, [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] sees just how remarkable the institution really is, and is introduced to [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s friends—[[Honey Lemon|Honey Lemon|annotation]], [[GoGo Tomago|GoGo|annotation]], [[Wasabi-No-Ginger|Wasabi|annotation]], and [[Fredzilla|Fred|annotation]].

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] also introduces [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] to [[Daniel Henney|his|PERSON_coref]] project [[Baymax|Baymax|annotation]], a personal healthcare robot.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] designs [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]] to have a huggable build.

[[Ryan Potter|Ryan Potter|annotation]] ([[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s voice actor) states that [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] sees [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a representation of [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]].

The experience inspires [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] to want to attend the school himself, and, with a small amount of help from [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Ryan Potter|he|PERSON_coref]] begins working on [[Ryan Potter|his|PERSON_coref]] own endeavor in order to gain admission.

With Professor [[Callaghan|PERSON]] still inside, [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] runs into the burning building in an effort to save [[Robert Callaghan|him|PERSON_coref]].

Moments later, the building explodes, killing [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] and as everyone else assumes, [[Callaghan|PERSON]].

[[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s school friends mourn [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] throughout the rest of [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], while most of [[Robert Callaghan|his|PERSON_coref]] legacy remains [[present|DATE]] in the form of [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Following [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s death, [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]] ends up taking over the role of being [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s emotional support.

A series of further events leads to the formation of a group who helps [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] investigate [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s death and the criminal plot that surrounds it: this same group would go on to honor [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s wisdom and dedication of helping people, through becoming the superhero team that would call themselves [[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6|alias_match_multiple_candidates]].

Prior to [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]]'s climax, [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]] shows video footage of [[Robert Callaghan|his|PERSON_coref]] testing by [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]], revealing it took [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] several [[dozen|NUMBER]] attempts to perfect [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s original programming, body, and their compatibility with each other.

In the Korean version of [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]], [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s name, which is of [[Japanese name|Japanese|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] origin, is changed to "Teddy".

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] briefly appears, as a recording, in the [[first|ORDINAL]] episode "[[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]] Returns".

[[Robert Callaghan|He|PERSON_coref]] also appears in "Obake Yashiki" where [[Robert Callaghan|he|PERSON_coref]] appears as an illusion created by augmented reality that made [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] to believe that [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] is alive.

In the season [[2|NUMBER]] finale "Legacies", [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] accepts [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s diploma on [[Robert Callaghan|his|PERSON_coref]] behalf at graduation.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] appears in the prequel manga, "[[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]]", which was released prior to [[Big Hero 6 (film)|the film|non_person_coref]]'s release, in [[August 2014|DATE]].

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] also appears in other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney|alias_match_popular_redirect]] books, such as "The Art of [[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]", and "[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]: [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]".

A review by [[Manohla Dargis|Manohla Dargis|annotation]] of "[[The New York Times|The New York Times|annotation]]" describes that [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] "isn't much better" than the "disappointingly bland maternal creation", [[Aunt Cass|PERSON]].

In [[Aunt Cass|her|PERSON_coref]] review, [[Manohla Dargis|Dargis|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] states that this is despite [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] being a "hunky brainiac who studies at an institute of higher nerdiness alongside a [[Scooby-Doo|Scooby Doo|annotation]]-like posse."

"[[The Japan Times|The Japan Times|annotation]]" describes that [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] "fits the normal Hollywood bill of a polite young [[Japanese people|Japanese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] male".

At [[one|NUMBER]] point in [[Robert Callaghan|his|PERSON_coref]] review, [[Sam Adams|PERSON]] of "[[IndieWire|Indiewire|annotation]]"s "[[IndieWire|Criticwire|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]" blog, writes that [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] has a "nurturing spirit".

Adams also criticizes [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s death, calling it "underplayed and unseen".

After mentioning another blogger's interpretation of why [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro|alias_match_single_candidate]] didn't want to lose [[Baymax|Baymax|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Adams|PERSON]] writes that, "Even in retrospect, [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]]'s death isn't rendered significant."

While looking for a replacement AI, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark|annotation]] looks through several other AIs; [[one|NUMBER]] is labeled [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi|alias_match_article_entity]] and another is [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta|annotation]] but both were passed over for [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.|F.R.I.D.A.Y.|annotation]].

Anne Fausto-Sterling

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Anne Fausto-Sterling|annotation]] (née [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Sterling|annotation]]; born [[July 30, 1944|DATE]]) is the [[Nancy Duke Lewis|PERSON]] Professor of Biology and Gender Studies at [[Brown University|Brown University|annotation]].

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] received [[her|PERSON]] [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts|annotation]] degree in zoology from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin|annotation]] in [[1965|DATE]] and [[her|PERSON]] Ph.D. in developmental genetics from [[Brown University|Brown University|annotation]] in [[1970|DATE]].

The [[second|ORDINAL]] edition of the [[first|ORDINAL]] of those books, "[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Myths of Gender|alias_match_article_entity]]", was published in [[1992|DATE]].

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] laid out a thought experiment considering an alternative model of gender containing [[five|NUMBER]] sexes: male, female, merm, ferm, and herm.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] serves on the editorial board of [[Signs (journal)|the journal|non_person_coref]] "Perspectives in Biology and Medicine" and on the advisory board of the feminist academic journal "[[Signs (journal)|Signs|annotation]]".

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] is married to [[Paula Vogel|Paula Vogel|annotation]], a [[Yale University|Yale|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] professor and [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer-winning playwright|annotation]].

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]]'s mother, [[Dorothy Sterling|Dorothy Sterling|annotation]], was a noted writer and historian while [[Dorothy Sterling|her|PERSON_coref]] father was also a published writer.

"Of Gender and Genitals" is the [[third|ORDINAL]] chapter of "Sexing the Body" by [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]]'s data goes on to state that genes alone do not decide phenotypes; phenotypes are instead decided by the environmental and developmental history of the person, in addition to their total genetic endowment.

Following a summary of the prior, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] shows [[Dorothy Sterling|her|PERSON_coref]] points on the gender development theories by noting how XY and XX chromosomes stay identical up until [[the 6th week|DATE]] of development in the womb.

After detailing the opinions of [[John Money|ORGANIZATION]] and [[Julianne Imperato-McGuinely|PERSON]] on gender identity, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] concludes with the [[three|NUMBER]] influences that affect gender – genetic regulatory information, intrusion from outside the womb, and "chance variation" in development – and [[two|NUMBER]] points on sexual development."

In chapter [[three|NUMBER]] of "Sexing the Body", "Of Gender and Genitals", [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] criticizes the standard model and the way it impacts those both neither male nor female.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] believes that as children grow and become either more masculine or feminine "nurture matters a great deal more than nature" because it affects the child's inclinations towards becoming hetero- or homo- sexual.

When doctors studied the spectrum of genders, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] criticized that "they never questioned the fundamental assumptions that there are only [[two|NUMBER]] sexes, because their goal in studying intersexual was to find out more about normal development."

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] strongly believes that doctors are unethical in that they do not allow variations of sex and immediately assign a sex within [[a few hours|DURATION]] of birth because there is not a way of telling whether the infant will be content with their assigned gender.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] argues that the consequence of performing sexual reassignment surgery on intersex infants "[develops] a language that reinforces the idea that lurking inside the mixed-sex child is a real male or female body."

In chapter [[three|NUMBER]] of the book "Sexing The Body", titled "Of Gender and Genitals", [[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] details the sexing of the human body.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling|Fausto-Sterling|alias_match_article_entity]] describes the "Phall-o-metrics", the measurement technique used to determine medically acceptable penis or clitoris.

Jupiter Dolichenus

[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|annotation]] was a Roman god whose mystery cult was widespread in the [[Roman Empire|Roman Empire|annotation]] from the early-2nd to mid-3rd [[centuries|DURATION]] AD.

Like several other figures of the mystery cults, [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of the so-called 'oriental' gods; that is [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_single_candidate]] re-inventions of ostensibly foreign figures in order to give their cults legitimacy and to distinguish them from the cults of the traditional [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_single_candidate]] gods.

Like the other mystery cults (including the other pseudo-oriental ones), the cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] gained popularity in the [[Roman Empire|Roman Empire|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a complement of the open 'public' religion of mainstream [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_single_candidate]] society.

her mysteries, the temples of the cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] were nominally closed to outsiders and followers had to undergo rites of initiation before they could be accepted as devotees. As a result, very little is known about the cult's beliefs and practices from the few clues that can be obtained from the sparse iconographic, archaeological or epigraphic evidence.

Until the late 20th-century, [[Roman Syria|Roman|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] exoticism was usually taken at face value, and [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was therefore like the other pseudo-oriental figures also assumed to have really been a [[Roman Syria|Roman|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] continuation of an oriental figure.

In the case of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]], the exoticism was attributed to an "interpretatio romana" derivation from a semitic [[Hadad|Hadad|annotation]]-[[Baal|Baal|annotation]]-[[Teshub|Teshub|annotation]] cult, which had its cult center on a hill near [[Dülük|Doliche|LOCATION_single_candidate]], [[30|NUMBER]] [[Roman Syria|Roman|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] Miles west of [[Samsat|Samosata|annotation]] on the [[Euphrates|Euphrates|annotation]], in the [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene|annotation]] in eastern [[Anatolia|Asia Minor|annotation]] (The present-day name of the hill is [[Baba Tepesi|PERSON]], "Father [[Teshub|Teshub|annotation]]".

It is from [[Rome|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Dülük|Doliche|alias_match_single_candidate]] that the epithet '[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]]' "of [[Dülük|Doliche|alias_match_single_candidate]]" was adopted.

(This development applies to all [[Roman Syria|Roman|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] 'oriental' gods equally; for a discussion of the issue in relation to [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]], see especially ).

The cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] is especially difficult to assess in this respect because the archaeological finds at [[Dülük|Dülük|alias_match_match_candidate]] indicate that, at some point, [[Roman Syria|Roman|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] material was "exported to" [[Dülük|Doliche|alias_match_single_candidate]], thus obscuring the distinction between [[Roman Syria|Roman|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] and native cult there.

These scholastic issues notwithstanding, the [[Roman Empire|Romans|alias_match_single_candidate]] perceived [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] as '[[Roman Syria|Syrian|annotation]]', and that perception, not the reality, influenced the [[Roman Empire|Roman world|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The earliest traces of the cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] appear in the early 2nd-century, perhaps as a by-product of contact between [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagenian|annotation]] troops during the allied [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]-[[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagenian|alias_match_single_candidate]] campaigns against the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Kingdom of Pontus|annotation]] in [[64 BC|DATE]], but perhaps also as a product of greatly embellished (or even freely invented) travel accounts or "colportage" which circulated around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean|annotation]] rim in the Hellenistic and early [[Roman Empire|Roman periods|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The cult is next attested in [[Rome|Rome|alias_match_popular_entity]], during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius|annotation]] ("r." [[161-180|NUMBER]]) when a temple to [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was built on the [[Caelian Hill|Caelian Hill|annotation]].

A once-held idea that the cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] received imperial support, in particular from the [[Severan dynasty|Severan|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] dynasts (who were of [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]]-African descent), is no longer followed.

Another older notion that [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was the tutelary divinity of the army is also obsolete.

Unlike the other pseudo-oriental mystery cults, the worship of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was very fixed on its '[[Dülük|Doliche|alias_match_single_candidate]]'/'[[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]]' exoticism and identity, which contributed to the cult's demise.

The archaeological record reveals violent destruction of all known [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] temples in the provinces on the [[Rhine|Rhine|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[Danube|Danube|LOCATION_popular_entity]] during the reign of [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximinus Thrax|annotation]] ("r." [[235-238|NUMBER]]).

The Thracian emperor is known to have filled [[Maximinus Thrax|his|PERSON_coref]] coffers from sanctuaries, and the cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was an easy target since it was not very widespread.

It appears that with the loss of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]]' ostensible main sanctuary, the god was permanently discredited in terms of [[Shapur I|his|PERSON_coref]] perceived power, and evidence of the cult ceased thereafter.

The last known [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] monument is from the [[Esquiline Hill|Esquiline Hill|annotation]] temple and dates to the reign of [[Gallienus|Gallienus|annotation]] ("r." [[253-268|NUMBER]]).

[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was always addressed in full as [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]], in [[Latin|Latin|alias_match_popular_entity]] epigraphical dative case abbreviated 'IOM Dolicheno', or '[[Iovi Optimo Maximo Dolicheno|PERSON]]' in full.

'[[Optimus Maximus|ORGANIZATION]]', meaning 'Best and Greatest', was the stock epithet of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter|annotation]], with whom [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was co-identified and for whom the term of respect was maintained.

[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] did however also receive some distinctive forms of address.

[[One|NUMBER]] inscription from a temple on the Aventine hill in [[Rome|Rome|alias_match_popular_entity]], for example, addresses [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] as 'eternal preserver', while another acknowledges the god as '[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] Eternal, preserver of the firmament, pre-eminent divinity, invincible provider'.

The cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] was a mystery religion whose customs and rituals were restricted to initiates.

The members of the community are introduced by the phrase '[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] chose the following to serve [[Antonius Mavius|him|PERSON_coref]]'.

Dedications to [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] by the commanders of provincial armies indicate there was a certain measure of support for the cult in high ranking army circles.

[[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] is frequently depicted in the company of [[Jupiter|Jupiter|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s consort, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno|annotation]].

Within the cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno|alias_match_single_candidate]] takes the name [[Juno (mythology)|Juno|alias_match_single_candidate]] Dolichena.

The cult of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] also gave prominence to [[Apollo|Apollo|annotation]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana|annotation]], who often appear on votive tablets as a pair of busts side by side.

Few of the characteristic attributes of [[Jupiter|Jupiter|alias_match_popular_entity]] appear in the representation of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]], apart from the thunderbolt, a beard, and at times the eagle.

In accord with [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] conventions, [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] is also depicted with [[Phrygian cap|Phrygian cap|annotation]] and trousers, thus presenting the god as "oriental".

The unique feature of representations of [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] is that [[Lucius Lucceius Martinus|he|PERSON_coref]] is almost always shown standing on the back of a bull.

There has been much speculation over the fact that [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] is always depicted as standing on the back of the animal.

At the temple to [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] at the Zugmantel, a [[Roman Empire|Roman|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] cohort post on the [[Limes Germanicus|Upper Limes Germanicus|annotation]] near present-day [[Taunusstein|Taunusstein, Germany|annotation]], the altar table was supported by legs carved in the shape of [[two|NUMBER]] bulls.

A temple to [[Jupiter Dolichenus|Jupiter Dolichenus|alias_match_article_entity]] is known as a "dolichenum", a modern term invented by archaeologists.

"[[Zbogom, Srbijo|Zbogom, Srbijo|alias_match_article_entity]]" is the last album recorded with guitarist [[Zoran Ilić|PERSON]].

The album's biggest hits were the ballad "Jedino moje" and the anti-war song "[[Zbogom, Srbijo|Zbogom, Srbijo|alias_match_article_entity]]".





Monarchy of Grenada

[[One|NUMBER]] of the most complicated features of the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenadian Monarchy|alias_match_article_entity]] is that it is a shared monarchy.

[[Sixteen|NUMBER]] of these states are specifically [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realm|annotation]]s who recognise the same person as their separate [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Head of State|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[one|NUMBER]] of these.

Despite sharing the same person as their respective monarch, each of the [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realms|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], including [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], is sovereign and independent of the others.

The [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarchy|alias_match_article_entity]] thus ceased to be an exclusively [[Commonwealth of Nations|British|alias_match_single_candidate]] institution, although it has often been called "[[Commonwealth of Nations|British|alias_match_single_candidate]]" since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, legal, and of convenience.

Under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] has a common monarchy with [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realms|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and though laws governing the line of succession to the [[Grenada|Grenadian|alias_match_single_candidate]] throne lie within the control of the [[Grenada|Grenadian|alias_match_single_candidate]] Parliament, [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment.

On all matters of the [[Grenada|Grenadian|alias_match_single_candidate]] State, the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] is advised solely by [[Grenada|Grenadian|alias_match_single_candidate]] ministers.

In [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s official title is: "[[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth the Second|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], by the [[Grace of God|ORGANIZATION]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom|alias_match_popular_redirect]] of Great Britain and [[Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Elizabeth II|Her|PERSON_coref]] other [[Commonwealth realm|Realms|alias_match_single_candidate]] and Territories, [[Head of the Commonwealth|Head of the Commonwealth|annotation]]".

This style communicates [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]]'s status as an independent monarchy, highlighting the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]]'s role specifically as [[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen of Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], as well as the shared aspect of the [[Elizabeth II|Crown|alias_match_single_candidate]] throughout the realms.

Typically, the [[Elizabeth II|Sovereign|alias_match_single_candidate]] is styled "[[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen of Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]]," and is addressed as such when in [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], or performing duties on behalf of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] abroad.

The role of the [[Elizabeth II|Sovereign|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s representative, the [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor-General|alias_match_single_candidate]], is determined by the Constitution of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[1973|DATE]]) and the constitutional conventions of the [[Westminster system|Westminster system|annotation]] of parliamentary government.

The [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor-General|alias_match_single_candidate]] is appointed by the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] upon the advice of the Prime [[Minister (government)|Minister of|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]].

The [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] is informed of the Prime [[Minister (government)|Minister|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s decision before the [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor General|alias_match_single_candidate]] gives [[Royal assent|Royal Assent|annotation]].

The power to appoint the Prime [[Minister (government)|Minister|alias_match_single_candidate]] and other constitutional powers are exclusively vested in the [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor General|alias_match_single_candidate]] and not the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen|alias_match_article_entity]] herself.

As such, the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen|alias_match_article_entity]] herself does not exercise reserve powers.

The [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] Constitution Order in Council was made at the request of the [[Associated State|ORGANIZATION]] of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], to provide a new constitution for [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], which would come into effect on termination of the status of association of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] with the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Most of the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen|alias_match_article_entity]]'s domestic duties are performed by the [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor General|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor-General|alias_match_single_candidate]] represents the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Queen|alias_match_article_entity]] on ceremonial occasions such as the opening of [[Westminster system|Parliament|alias_match_single_candidate]], the presentation of honours and military parades.

As in the other [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realms|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], however, the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]]'s role, and thereby the vice-regent's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments operate, and the powers that are constitutionally [[hers|PERSON]] are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of the Cabinet, made up of [[Minister (government)|Ministers|alias_match_single_candidate]] of the [[Elizabeth II|Crown|alias_match_single_candidate]].

In exceptional circumstances, however, the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] or vice-regal can act against such advice based upon [[his|PERSON]] or [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|her|PERSON_coref]] reserve powers.

It is also possible that if the [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor General|alias_match_single_candidate]] decided to go against the Prime [[Minister (government)|Minister|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s or the government's advice, the Prime [[Minister (government)|Minister|alias_match_single_candidate]] could appeal directly to the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]], or even recommend that the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] dismiss the [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor General|alias_match_single_candidate]].

In [[2011|DATE]], [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]], along with the other [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] prime ministers agreed in the [[Perth Agreement|Perth Agreement|annotation]] to amend the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement ([[26 March 2015|DATE]]), instead of male-preference primogeniture, and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the [[Church of England|Church of England|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]].

This legislation lays out the rules that the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] cannot be a Roman Catholic, nor married to [[one|NUMBER]], and must be in communion with the [[Church of England|Church of England|annotation]] upon ascending the throne.

As [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]]'s laws governing succession are [[currently|DATE]] identical to those of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom|alias_match_popular_entity]] (by the "[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster|alias_match_single_candidate]]") see Succession to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British|alias_match_single_candidate]] Throne for more information.

All laws in [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] are enacted with the sovereign's, or the vice-regal's signature.

The Vice-Regals may reserve a bill for the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]]'s pleasure, that is to say, allow the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] to make a personal decision on the bill.

The [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] has the power to disallow a bill (within a time limit specified by the constitution).

ent) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch|alias_match_article_entity]] personally are not cognizable

In [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]] the legal personality of the [[State|ORGANIZATION]] is referred to as "[[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen|alias_match_single_candidate]] in Right of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_m

" For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the government, the respondent is formally described as [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen|alias_match_single_candidate]] in Right of [[Monarchy of Grenada|Grenada|alias_match_article_entity]]. The monarch as an individual takes no more role in such an affair than in any other business of government.

James Hampton (artist)

[[James Hampton (artist)|James Hampton|annotation]] ([[April 8, 1909|DATE]] – [[November 4, 1964|DATE]]) was an American outsider artist, originally from [[South Carolina|South Carolina|annotation]] but based in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.|annotation]] for much of [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] life.

[[James Hampton (artist)|James Hampton|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[1909|DATE]] in [[Elloree, South Carolina|Elloree, South Carolina|annotation]] as [[one|NUMBER]] of [[four|NUMBER]] children to [[James Sr.|ORGANIZATION]] and [[Sarah|PERSON]] ([[Johnson|PERSON]]) [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

[[James Hampton (artist)|His|PERSON_coref]] father, who had abandoned the family, was a gospel singer and a traveling [[Baptists|Baptist|annotation]] preacher who was also a known criminal who had worked on chain gangs.

In [[1928|DATE]], [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]. and shared an apartment with [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] older brother Lee.

Hampton worked as a short-order cook until [[1943|DATE]] when [[James Hampton (artist)|he|PERSON_coref]] was drafted into the [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army Air Forces|annotation]].

[[James Hampton (artist)|He|PERSON_coref]] served with the [[385th Aviation Squadron|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Texas|Texas|annotation]], [[Hawaii|Hawaii|annotation]] and in the jungles of [[Saipan|Saipan|annotation]] and [[Guam|Guam|annotation]].

Hampton built a small, shrine-like object during [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] time in [[Guam|Guam|alias_match_match_candidate]] that [[James Hampton (artist)|he|PERSON_coref]] later incorporated into [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] larger artwork.

[[James Hampton (artist)|He|PERSON_coref]] was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star|annotation]] and was honorably discharged in [[1945|DATE]], after which [[James Hampton (artist)|he|PERSON_coref]] returned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington|alias_match_single_candidate]].

In [[1946|DATE]], [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was hired by the [[General Services Administration|General Services Administration|annotation]] as a janitor and worked there until [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] death.

In [[1950|DATE]], [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] rented a garage on [[7th|ORDINAL]] street in northwest [[Washington, D.C.|Washington|alias_match_single_candidate]].

Over [[the next 14 years|DURATION]], [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] built a complex work of religious art inside the garage with various scavenged materials such as aluminum and gold foil, old furniture, pieces of cardboard, light bulbs, jelly jars, shards of mirror and desk blotters held together with tacks, glue, pins and tape.

The text "[[James Hampton (artist)|The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly|alias_match_article_entity]]" was written on the objects in [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s handwriting.

Hampton described [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] work as a monument to Jesus in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington|alias_match_single_candidate]].

It was made based on several religious visions that prompted [[James Hampton (artist)|him|PERSON_coref]] to prepare for [[Jesus|Christ|annotation]]'s return to earth.

Hampton recorded "the Old and the New Covenant" and [[a second|DURATION]] set of commandments, which [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] believed [[God|God|alias_match_match_candidate]] had given to [[James Hampton (artist)|him|PERSON_coref]] to pass along because man no longer followed the original [[Ten Commandments|Ten Commandments|annotation]].

Some of the text was accompanied by notes in English in [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s handwriting.

In the notebook, [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] referred to himself as St. [[James Hampton (artist)|James|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] with the title "Director, Special Projects for the State of Eternity" and ended each page with the word "[[Book of Revela

Hampton approached local churches about using [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] creation as a teaching tool but none were interested.

The art was not discovered until after [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s death in [[1964|DATE]], when the owner of the garage, [[Meyer Wertlieb|PERSON]], came to find out why the rent had not been paid.

[[Jesus|He|alias_match_single_candidate]] knew that [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had been building something in the garage.

When [[James Hampton (artist)|he|PERSON_coref]] opened the door, [[James Hampton (artist)|he|PERSON_coref]] found a room filled with the artwork.

Hampton had kept [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] project secret from most of [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] friends and family.

[[James Hampton (artist)|His|PERSON_coref]] relatives [[first|ORDINAL]] heard about it when [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] sister came to claim [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] body.

When [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s sister refused to take the artwork, the landlord placed an advertisement in local newspapers.

Ed [[Kelly|PERSON]], a sculptor, answered the advertisement and was so astounded by the exhibit, [[James Hampton (artist)|he|PERSON_coref]] contacted art collector [[Alice Denney|PERSON]].

The story of [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[James Hampton (artist)|his|PERSON_coref]] artwork finally became public in the [[December 15, 1964|DATE]] issue of the "[[The Washington Post|Washington Post|annotation]]".

Lowe paid [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s outstanding rent and took possession of the art display.

In [[1970|DATE]], [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s work was donated to the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian American Art Museum|annotation]], where it has been on display ever since.

Author and poet [[Denis Johnson|Denis Johnson|annotation]] published a book with the name "[[The Washington Post|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] Throne of the [[Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly|ORGANIZATION]]: Poems Collected and New", which includes a poem named after [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s work.

In [[2007|DATE]], composer [[Jefferson Friedman|Jefferson Friedman|annotation]] premiered a musical piece inspired by [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s artwork titled "[[The Washington Post|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] Throne of the [[Third Heaven|ORGANIZATION]]," commissioned jointly by the [[National Symphony Orchestra|National Symphony Orchestra|annotation]] and the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP Foundation|annotation]].

In [[2015|DATE]], author [[Shelley Pearsall|PERSON]] published a young adult novel, "[[The Washington Post|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Seventh|ORDINAL]] Most Important Thing", which put the artwork and the artist in a fictional context, imagining a meeting between [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and a troubled [[thirteen-year-old|DURATION]] boy.

[[The Washington Post|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] author says [[Shelley Pearsall|she|PERSON_coref]] was inspired by the fact that "for [[more than a decade|DURATION]], [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had labored alone, without fanfare, to create art for art's sake – a nearly impossible concept to grasp in [[today|DATE]]'s world of rampant social-media sharing and instant celebrity."

In [[2018|DATE]], Cheyenne/Arapaho author [[Tommy Orange|Tommy Orange|annotation]] published a short story, "[[The Washington Post|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] State," that references [[James Hampton (artist)|Hampton|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[The Washington Post|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] Throne of the [[Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly|ORGANIZATION]].





Abhimanyu Rajp

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|Abhimanyu Rajp|alias_match_article_entity]] (born [[8 March 1986|DATE]]) is an [[India|India|annotation]]n born American cricketer.

Along with being primarily a right-handed off-spinner [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] is also a handy batsman.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] started playing cricket professionally at an early age and represented [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] city [[Ludhiana|Ludhiana|annotation]] at the U-14 and U-16 district levels.

Later, [[Rajp|PERSON]], who was [[14|NUMBER]] at the [[time|DATE]], along with [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] family moved to the [[United States|United States of America|alias_match_popular_redirect]] in [[the year 2000|DATE]].

Soon after, [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] was labelled as [[one|NUMBER]] to watch for [[the future|DATE]] by various critics in the [[United States national cricket team|USA cricket|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] circuit.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] was also the captain of [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]]'s [[South West Region|LOCATION]] Under-19 team from [[2004|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[2006|DATE]], which participates in the annual [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[India|National|alias_match_single_candidate]] Under-19 Tournaments.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] was part of the [[first|ORDINAL]] generation of [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] cricketers in the Under-19 structure of [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] that started with the [[first|ORDINAL]] Under-19 [[India|National|alias_match_single_candidate]] Tournament in [[2004|DATE]].

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] grabbed the best bowler of the tournament and [[two|NUMBER]] man of the match awards.

Rajp ended the tournament with a tournament-high [[11|NUMBER]] wickets in [[four|NUMBER]] games and marked [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] arrival.

Rajp's [[first|ORDINAL]] major test came in the form of the [[2006|DATE]] [[International Cricket Council|ICC|ORGANIZATION_single_candidate]] Under-19 Cricket World Cup in [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka|alias_match_match_candidate]], in which [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] was promoted to be the vice-captain of the [[United States national under-19 cricket team|United States Under-19 cricket team|annotation]] due to [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] performances at the [[ICC U19 Cricket World Cup Americas Qualifier|ICC Americas Under-19 Championship|annotation]] and [[India|National|alias_match_single_candidate]] Under-19 Tournaments.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] had a successful World Cup campaign and finished the tournament as [[one|NUMBER]] of the leading wicket takers for the [[United States|US|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] and also landed himself in the top [[10|NUMBER]] wicket takers for the entire tournament, in number of wickets taken.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|His|PERSON_coref]] most notable performance came against an [[International Cricket Council|ICC|ORGANIZATION_single_candidate]] full-member nation, [[New Zealand|New Zealand|annotation]], when [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] took the [[first|ORDINAL]] (and the only till date) five-wicket haul for the [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] against a full member nation.

Rajp's name slowly faded away on the national circuit and was off the radar for [[the next few years|DURATION]] before making [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] resurgence in [[2010|DATE]].

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] plays in the [[Southern California Cricket Association|ORGANIZATION]], which is based in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[California|California|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and represents the [[South West Region|LOCATION]] in [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[India|National|alias_match_single_candidate]] Cricket Tournaments.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] has had a good showing in domestic tournaments with the most recent being the best bowler at the [[2010|DATE]] [[Western Conference|ORGANIZATION]], where [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] also created a national level record, which stands till date, for taking [[7|NUMBER]] wickets in [[one|NUMBER]] innings, at a national tournament game against the [[Central East|LOCATION]] region.

Later [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] went on to become the best bowler for the [[second|ORDINAL]] time in a calendar [[year|DURATION]] and this time it was at the [[2010|DATE]] [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]] Senior [[India|National|alias_match_single_candidate]] tournament.

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] would later go [[one|NUMBER]] to make the [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] [[India|National|alias_match_single_candidate]] Squad in [[2012|DATE]].

Rajp made [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] debut in [[2012|DATE]] when [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] was selected as to be a part of the [[United States national cricket team|United States national cricket team|annotation]] at the [[2012|DATE]] [[International Cricket Council|ICC|alias_match_single_candidate]] World Twenty20 Qualifier in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE|annotation]] in [[March 2012|DATE]].

[[Abhimanyu Rajp|He|PERSON_coref]] debuted in style against [[Italy|Italy|annotation]] when [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] took a wicket with [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] very [[first|ORDINAL]] delivery and scored an unbeaten [[14|NUMBER]] runs off [[9|NUMBER]] balls in a match that [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] lost by [[8|NUMBER]] runs.

Rajp had a very successful debut tournament, finishing at the top in the wickets department for [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] team and in the top [[ten|NUMBER]] on the list of highest wicket takers for the entire tournament (in number of wickets taken).

Following [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] performances with the ball [[Abhimanyu Rajp|he|PERSON_coref]] was also the [[one|NUMBER]] of the best fielder in [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] team, with team high [[6|NUMBER]] catches, and finished the tournament in the Top [[Three|NUMBER]] (in amount of fielding dismissals).

Awarding [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] success at the [[2012|DATE]] [[International Cricket Council|ICC|alias_match_single_candidate]] World Twenty20 Qualifier, [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] debut tour for the Senior national team, the selectors picked Rajp as [[one|NUMBER]] of the members of the [[United States national cricket team|United States national cricket team|annotation]] for the [[2012|DATE]] [[International Cricket Council|ICC|alias_match_single_candidate]] World Cricket League Division Four which took place from [[3|NUMBER]] to [[10 September 2012|DATE]] in [[Malaysia|Malaysia|annotation]].

Although, [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] aggressive bowling as not enough for the [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] to win the Auty Cup title, it surely helped [[Abhimanyu Rajp|his|PERSON_coref]] case to become a regular fixture in the [[United States|USA|alias_match_popular_redirect]] squad.

Burhan Ghalioun

[[Burhan Ghalioun|Burhan Ghalioun|annotation]] ([[برهان|NUMBER]] غليون; born [[11 February 1945|DATE]] in [[Homs|Homs|annotation]], [[Syria|Syria|annotation]]) is a [[French people|French|annotation]]-[[Syrians|Syrian|annotation]] professor of sociology at the [[University of Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3|Université de Paris III Sorbonne University|annotation]] in [[Paris|Paris|annotation]], and the [[first|ORDINAL]] chairman of the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian opposition Transitional National Council|annotation]] ([[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_single_candidate]]).

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] was named chairman on [[29 August 2011|DATE]].

[[Burhan Ghalioun|His|PERSON_coref]] chairmanship was criticized for [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] perceived closeness to the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood|annotation]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] early reluctance to arm opposition forces, and what opponents called the autocratic nature of [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] leadership.

On [[17 May 2012|DATE]], feeling [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] had become an increasingly divisive figure for the council, [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] resigned.

Born in [[Homs|Homs|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[1945|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] is a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni|annotation]] [[Muslims|Muslim|alias_match_popular_redirect]].

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] studied sociology and philosophy at the [[Damascus University|University of Damascus|annotation]].

In [[1969|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] moved to [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_match_candidate]], where [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] received a PhD in social science from the [[University of Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis|University of Paris VIII|annotation]] and another in humanities from [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne University|annotation]].

In the late [[1970s|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] made a name as an opponent of President [[Hafez al-Assad|Hafez Assad|annotation]] by publishing a pamphlet titled "A Manifesto for Democracy".

Though the pamphlet gave [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] a reputation as a leading opposition figure, [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] avoided party politics throughout [[the 1980s|DATE]].

However, [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] remained a public critic of the [[Hafez al-Assad|Assad|alias_match_single_candidate]] government and a supporter of the Palestinian cause.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]], from [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] home in [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_match_candidate]], began to visit [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_match_candidate]] more frequently for [[the next 12 months|DURATION]], and became more active in [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] politics.

In [[2011|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] discussed a lecture with [[Jadaliyya|Jadaliyya|annotation]]: "The [[Ba|ORGANIZATION]]'th authority was shocked that over [[700|NUMBER]] people attended my lecture, news of which spread by word of mout

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] soon after decided that the new "political openness" had come to an end later in [[2001|DATE]] and chose to stay in [[France|France|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[now|DATE]] [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] home country of [[32 years|DURATION]], to concentrate on [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] academic work.

In [[2005|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to political activity in the period of the [[Damascus Declaration|Damascus Declaration|annotation]].

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] argued that [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] opposition groups should avoid alliances with Western governments against the government, but rather work from within.

When [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_match_candidate]] saw the [[first|ORDINAL]] popular protests in [[March 2011|DATE]] as part of the broader [[Arab Spring|Arab Spring|annotation]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] immediately supported the protesters in the media.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] also began working to bring together opposition groups.

Following the [[Antalya Conference for Change in Syria|Antalya Conference for Change in Syria|annotation]] in [[early June 2011|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] criticized the event as "serving foreign agendas," which prompted [[one|NUMBER]] of the organizers, [[Abdulrazak Eid|Abdulrazak Eid|annotation]], to accuse [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] of attempting to appease the regime.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] was named its head and was viewed as a leader who could work with both Western governments and [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Islamists.

However, [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] leadership was criticized from the start by some fellow opposition members, who felt [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] was "not up to the job".

Others stated that [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] was too close to the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood|annotation]] and was attempting to monopolize power.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] initially opposed the militarization of the opposition, preferring to work to a negotiated solution to the crisis.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] was named for an additional [[three-month|DURATION]] term in [[February 2012|DATE]], a decision which caused several member organizations to resign from the council in protest.

On [[May 15|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] term was renewed for [[another three months|DURATION]].

In an attempt to heal growing divisions in the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] announced for the [[first|ORDINAL]] time [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] support for providing weapons to the [[Free Syrian Army|Free Syrian Army|annotation]].

When the [[Local Coordination Committees of Syria|Local Co-ordination Committees|annotation]] threatened to leave the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_single_candidate]], however, [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] resigned [[two days later|DATE]], stating that [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] did not wish to be "the candidate of division".

[[Burhan Ghalioun|His|PERSON_coref]] resignation was welcomed by some [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_single_candidate]] members but criticized by others, who felt that resigning immediately following [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] re-election gave the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_single_candidate]] a further appearance of being in disarray.

On [[10 June|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] was replaced by Kurdish activist [[Abdulbaset Sieda|Abdulbaset Sieda|annotation]].

[[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] visited [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_match_candidate]] on [[19 June|DATE]], crossing into the north of [[Turkey|the country|non_person_coref]] from [[Turkey|Turkey|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and traveling incognito.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] met with rebels and activists, and stated that [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] concluded from [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] visit that [[Hafez al-Assad|Assad|alias_match_single_candidate]] had "lost control on the ground".

[[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_article_entity]] has generally avoided association with political movements such as [[Nasserism|Nasserism|annotation]], [[Islamism|Islamism|annotation]], or communism.

[[Burhan Ghalioun|He|PERSON_coref]] sees democracy as "a panacea for the [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]] world" and a "historical necessity", arguing that [[Arabs|Arab|alias_match_popular_redirect]] governments have failed to build successful nation states out of their nationalist movements, and that opposition to those governments must center on demands for democratic reforms.

In [[2011|DATE]], [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] stated [[Burhan Ghalioun|his|PERSON_coref]] belief that given the [[Hafez al-Assad|Assad|alias_match_single_candidate]] administration's persistent repressive policies and its "refusal to reach an understanding with its people", [[Syrians|Syrians|alias_match_match_candidate]] have only [[two|NUMBER]] options.

[[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]]'s nearest other general store in those [[days|DURATION]] was [[Hollis|PERSON]]'s Store at Pinket.

This little cottage, called "The Mews", then opened as temporary premises for the [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] Store.

The shelves were crowded with general merchandise and groceries, and [[once|DATE]] again [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] had its own commercial centre.

According to one-time shop-keeper at the old [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] Store, the late [[Maureen Morgan|PERSON]], the shop originally had a narrow straight-iron verandah which was replaced in (about) [[1918|DATE]] with a bull-nosed frontage.

Although most of the poles taken down were removed from [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]], the last telegraph pole to be taken down in the village is [[now|DATE]] a log seat in the market ground behind the store.

There is still an underground pipe from the artesian well behind the shop (in the market ground) to the water supply for the School-of-arts, however the rainfall at [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] usually kept the galley in good supply.

Postal services are [[now|DATE]] handled by courier from [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes|annotation]], although the [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] Store was licensed as a Stamp Vendor.

The School-of-arts is [[now|DATE]] managed jointly by the [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] Soldier's Memorial Trust and the [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] Recreational Trust Sub-management Committee.

The most recent noteworthy activity being the annual [[Red Range, New South Wales|Red Range|alias_match_article_entity]] Carriage Riding Event established by [[Denise Lute|PERSON]] and the late [[Denise Griffin|PERSON]].

In the [[second|ORDINAL]] part of [[Emil Protalinski|his|PERSON_coref]] review of [[Windows 7|Windows 7|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Peter Bright|PERSON]] of "[[Ars Technica|Ars Technica|alias_match_match_candidate]]" wrote that "the value proposition of the [[Windows Ultimate Extras|Ultimate Extras|alias_match_article_entity]] was nothing short of piss-poor."

Dorothea Primrose Campbell

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Dorothea Primrose Campbell|annotation]] ([[4 May 1793|DATE]] – [[6 January 1863|DATE]]) was a poet, novelist and teacher from [[Shetland|Shetland|annotation]] in [[Scotland|Scotland|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|She|PERSON_coref]] wrote a novel, "Harley Radington: A Tale" ([[1821|DATE]]), and had poems and short fiction printed in [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]] periodicals.

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Her|PERSON_coref]] melodic, whimsical poetry and [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] works of fiction are seen as revealing works that cover historical and societal barriers which [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] herself was facing.

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Dorothea Primrose Campbell|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[Lerwick|Lerwick|annotation]] on [[4 May 1793|DATE]] and was baptised on [[11 May|DATE]] in [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] birthplace.

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Her|PERSON_coref]] father, [[Duncan Campbell|Duncan Campbell|PERSON_human_disambiguation]], was a surgeon who had married [[Elizabeth|PERSON]] ([[Eliza|LOCATION]]), [[one|NUMBER]] of the Scotts of Scottshall in [[Scalloway|Scalloway|annotation]].

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Dorothea|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was the eldest of the family, with a younger sister and [[two|NUMBER]] brothers.

The many difficulties included long family struggles with debts from [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] grandfather, [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] mother's struggle against opium addiction, and the death of [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] father when [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] was just [[16|NUMBER]].

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Dorothea Primrose Campbell|alias_match_article_entity]] was well educated and appears to have begun writing poetry at a very young age.

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|She|PERSON_coref]] later used [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] writing abilities to support [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] family.

By [[1812|DATE]] [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] had become a teacher and in [[1813|DATE]] opened [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] own school in [[Lerwick|Lerwick|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Through [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] family connections [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] met [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott|annotation]], a distant relative, during [[Walter Scott|his|PERSON_coref]] tour of the north of [[Scotland|Scotland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] aboard the [[Lighthouse Commission|ORGANIZATION]]'s yacht.

[[Walter Scott|Scott|alias_match_single_candidate]] was encouraging and even shipped [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] a piano for the little school [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] had established.

However, the school closed due to [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s poor health and [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] mother's opium addiction.

After the closure, [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] worked as a schoolteacher to support [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] family.

During a correspondence between [[1817|DATE]] [[and|DATE]] [[1821|DATE]], [[Walter Scott|Walter Scott|alias_match_match_candidate]] offered [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] moral and financial support.

Nonetheless, court records reveal that [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] owed sums to creditors in [[1822|DATE]], [[1823|DATE]], [[and 1835|DATE]].

In [[1841|DATE]], [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] was invited to move from [[Shetland|Shetland|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]], to serve as a governess to Dr [[Clarke|PERSON]]'s family, which consisted of [[Clarke|his|PERSON_coref]] daughter, [[Eliza Frances Hook|PERSON]], and [[Eliza|PERSON]]'s husband, [[James Hook|James Hook|PERSON_human_disambiguation]].

Unfortunately, the [[Clarke|PERSON]] family soon went bankrupt and [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was left unemployed in [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In the [[1841|DATE]] [[England Census|ORGANIZATION]], [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] is listed as governess to [[seven|NUMBER]] children of the [[Richard Smith|Richard Smith|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] family at [[Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington|annotation]], [[Middlesex|Middlesex|annotation]].

Campbell applied unsuccessfully for several jobs, but as a woman over [[forty|NUMBER]] and a Shetlander, the prejudices against [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] were strong.

The Fund paid [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] [[£30|MONEY]].

Eventually [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] was also able to find a job teaching at [[Sevenoaks|Sevenoaks|annotation]].

In the [[1851|DATE]] [[England Census|ORGANIZATION]], [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] is listed as living alone at [[16|NUMBER]] Quartre Bras, [[Hexham|Hexham|annotation]], [[Northumberland|Northumberland|annotation]], assisted by a pension from the Governesses' Benevolent Institution.

In [[January of 1863|DATE]], [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] died at the Aged Governesses' Asylum in [[Kentish Town|Kentish Town|annotation]] in [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]], where [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] had been living as an inmate at the [[time|DATE]] of the [[1861|DATE]] [[England Census|ORGANIZATION]].

On [[10 January 1863|DATE]], [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] was buried at the former parish of [[St James|ORGANIZATION]], [[Hampstead Road|LOCATION]], [[St Pancras|LOCATION]], [[Camden Town|Camden|annotation]].

Aspiring to relieve [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] family's grim financial status, [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] corresponded with the publisher [[J. Young|PERSON]], whose support meant that [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s "Poems" were published in duodecimo at [[Inverness|Inverness|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1811|DATE]].

Records show that [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] was only [[ten years old|DURATION]] when [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|she|PERSON_coref]] wrote "Address to the [[Evening|TIME]] Star," which was not published until [[1811|DATE]], when [[Dorothea

However, [[one|NUMBER]] critic notes that [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s poems published at [[Inverness|Inverness|LOCATION_popular_entity]] "do not read like juvenilia. They are flowing, expressive, verbally and musically skilled, whether in conventional poetic diction or more colloquial mode."

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s [[second|ORDINAL]], [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]] edition of "Poems" appeared in [[November 1816|DATE]].

It included some poems from [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] volume.

[[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s straits appear as [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] "tone becomes progressively darker, dwelling on death and the slights meted out to poverty."

In [[October 1821|DATE]], [[A. K. Newman|PERSON]] of [[Minerva Press|ORGANIZATION]] published "Harley Radington: A Tale", [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s [[one|NUMBER]] known novel.

The tale, set in [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] birthplace, the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], impressed and interested a handful of readers.

In [[1823|DATE]], William [[Walter Scott|Scott|alias_match_single_candidate]] Burn exalted [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s writing capabilities in a letter to [[Walter Scott|his|PERSON_coref]] friend: "I read your Miss [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s [[Harley Radington|PERSON]] when I was ill – that woman has very considerable talent, and should be encouraged to employ it oftener."

Campbell seems to have been trying to fit [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] novel into a national-tale category along with concurrent works by others set in [[Ireland|Ireland|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and the [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highlands|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Presumably, [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] decided to subtitle the book "A Tale" over "A [[Shetland|Zetland|alias_match_single_candidate]] Tale" due to [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|her|PERSON_coref]] uncertainty that the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] would be accepted by the public as a novel "set in [[Scottish Highlands|the region|non_person_coref]]s of [[Great Britain|Great Britain|LOCATION_popular_entity]]," as [[Shetland|Shetland|alias_match_match_candidate]] was seen by many in [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] as a "little-known country" at the [[time|DATE]].

There are conflicting accounts of how long [[Dorothea Primrose Campbell|Campbell|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote for the "[[The Lady's Monthly Museum|Lady's Monthly Museum|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]".

British Society for Research on Ageing

The [[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|annotation]] ([[British Society for Research on Ageing|BSRA|annotation]]) is a scientific society (registered charity no. [[1174127|NUMBER]]) which promotes research to understand the causes and effects of the ageing process.

According to the earliest rules of the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[1954|DATE]]):

Thus, the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|Society|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] seeks to improve understanding of the fundamental biology of ageing, as well as to educate the public regarding the scientific developments taking place in the field of modern gerontology.

Conceived by [[Richard Faragher|PERSON]] and noted jewellery designer [[Clara Vichi|PERSON]], the badge incorporates a stylised shell motif and the initials of the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|alias_match_article_entity]].

Contiguous internal [[minutes|DURATION]] for the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[British Society for Research on Ageing|BSRA|acronym]]) are only currently available from [[June 1954|DATE]] onwards.

This tallies closely with the chronology in [[Korenchevsky|LOCATION]]'s [[The BMJ|BMJ|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] article of [[1952|DATE]] as well as to [[Edward Stieglitz|his|PERSON_coref]] reference to an active executive committee for the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|BSRA|acronym_ner]] in [[1950|DATE]] where it was funded by [[Lord Nuffield|ORGANIZATION]] to participate in a round-table conference with the "American delegation to the [[First International Gerontological Congress|ORGANIZATION]]".

This appears to be [[one|NUMBER]] of the earliest extant uses of the term "[[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|alias_match_article_entity]]" as opposed to the "British Branch of the [[Club for Research|ORGANIZATION]] on Ageing" and therefore represents a watershed date.

There is also a reference to the "Scottish Branch of the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|alias_match_article_entity]]" which Korenchevsky described in [[1951|DATE]] as "established and organised by Prof. Crew [Professor [[F.A.E Crew of Edinburgh University|ORGANIZATION]]] in [[1947|DATE]] to stimulate and unite gerontologic and geriatric activities in [[Scotland|Scotland|LOCATION_popular_entity]]".

It is also consistent with [[Korenchevsky|ORGANIZATION]]'s statement of [[1951|DATE]] that the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|BSRA|acronym_ner]] "has organised its own annual conferences".

Thus, the [[2010|DATE]] annual scientific meeting of the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|British Society for Research on Ageing|alias_match_article_entity]] was the [[60th|ORDINAL]] annual general meeting.

In [[early 1952|DATE]] Prof RE Tunbridge (elected a member of the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|BSRA|acronym_ner]] executive committee in [[1954|DATE]]) had asked the Foundation if it was willing to hold a related conference on ageing close to the time of the [[third|ORDINAL]] [[Congress|ORGANIZATION]] of the [[IAG|ORGANIZATION]] ([[July 1954|DATE]]).

Prominent international scientists with connections to the [[British Society for Research on Ageing|BSRA|acronym_ner]] and the IAGB also attended ([[e.g. Cowdry|ORGANIZATION]], [[Vezar|PERSON]] and [[Brull|PERSON]])as did American researchers connected to the [[GSA|ORGANIZATION]] such as [[Nathan Shock|ORGANIZATION]] and [[McCay|PERSON]].

In particular English theatre saw a "'pseudo-[[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]]' burlesque stage tradition.

According to [[one|NUMBER]] recent scholar, "the sixteenth-century stage image of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] as a proponent of political deception of and power-for-power's sake persists [[today|DATE]], and for most readers the term '[[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]]' still carries negative connotations associated with this conception of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|him|PERSON_coref]]".

The word "[[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]]" is widely used as a pejorative to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] advised most famously in "

The [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary|annotation]] defines "[[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]]" (as an adjective) as: "Of, pertaining to, or characteristic of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], or [[Niccolò Machiavelli|his|PERSON_coref]] alleged principles; following the methods recommended by [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in preferring expediency to morality; practicing duplicity in statecraft or in general conduct; astute, cunning, intriguing".

In so far as the [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]] idea has a great relationship with [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s philosophy, it relates to [[Niccolò Machiavelli|his|PERSON_coref]] most famous work, "[[The Prince|Il Principe|annotation]]", or "[[The Prince|The Prince|alias_match_match_candidate]]."

[[Denis Diderot|Denis Diderot|annotation]], the French philosopher, viewed [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellianism|alias_match_article_entity]] as "an abhorrent type of politics" and the "art of tyranny".

The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre|annotation]] of [[Huguenots|Huguenot|annotation]] [[Protestantism|Protestants|alias_match_popular_redirect]] in [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1572|DATE]] was a particular nexus of complaints about [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellianism|alias_match_article_entity]], as the massacre came to be seen as a product of it.

The massacre "spawned a pullulating mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, prejudices and phobias", in which [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellianism|alias_match_article_entity]] featured prominently.

In fact there is little trace of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[Huguenots|French|alias_match_single_candidate]] writings before the massacre, and not very much after, until [[Gentillet|PERSON]]'s own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellianism|alias_match_article_entity]].

The [[Catholic Encyclopedia|Catholic Encyclopedia|annotation]] of [[1913|DATE]] endorsed a version of this view, describing the massacres as "an entirely political act committed in the name of the immoral principles of [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellianism|alias_match_article_entity]]" and blaming "the pagan theories of a certain raison d'état according to which the end justified the means".

In "[[The Jew of Malta|The Jew of Malta|annotation]]" ([[1589|DATE]]–[[90|NUMBER]]) "[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavel|alias_match_single_candidate]]" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming to not be dead, but to have possessed the soul of the Duke of Guise, considered the mastermind of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], "And, [[now|DATE]] the [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Guise|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] is dead, is come from [[France|France|LOCATION_popular_entity]]/ To view this land, and frolic with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|his|PERSON_coref]] friends" (Prologue, lines [[3-4|NUMBER]]) [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|His|PERSON_coref]] last play, "[[The Massacre at Paris|The Massacre at Paris|annotation]]" ([[1593|DATE]]) takes the massacre, and [[the following years|DATE]], as its subject, with Guise and [[Catherine de' Medici|Catherine de' Medici|annotation]] both depicted as [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]] plotters, bent on evil from the start.

The figure of the [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavel|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama|annotation]] "combined elements of the Vice character (the comic villain from [[medieval|DATE]] morality drama) with a negative caricature of [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellian|alias_match_article_entity]] ideology as godless, scheming and self-interested."

The [[two|NUMBER]] levels of [[Machiavellianism (politics)|Machiavellianism|alias_match_article_entity]] both feature in the case of [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|annotation]], a favourite of [[Elizabeth I|Elizabeth I of England|annotation]].

Jackson Sun ([[2018|DATE]]) lists the following [[five|NUMBER]] varieties of [[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]].

*Central [[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[Horpa language|Stau|alias_match_article_entity]]-Dgebshes) is widely spoken in [[Rta’u County|LOCATION]] ([[Daofu County|LOCATION]] 道孚县) and [[Rongbrag County|ORGANIZATION]] ([[Danba County|LOCATION]] 丹巴县), [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Dkarmdzes|alias_match_single_candidate]] Prefecture, as well as a few villages in western [[Chuchen County|LOCATION]] ([[Jinchuan County|LOCATION]] 金川县), [[Rngaba Prefecture|LOCATION]].

It is the most conservative [[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]] variety, and preserves many archaic morphological features.

For this lect, "Ethnologue" lists the name sTodsde ([[Horpa language|Shangzhai|alias_match_article_entity]] 上寨, Western Jiarong).

According to "Ethnologue", sTodsde is spoken in [[Horpa language|Shangzhai|alias_match_article_entity]] district, southern [[Rangtang County|LOCATION]], where it is spoken in the townships of [[Puxi|LOCATION]], [[Shili|PERSON]], and Zongke townships, and around the Duke and [[Zhongke rivers|ORGANIZATION]]' confluence.

Additionally, Gates ([[2010|DATE]]) considers Erkai to be a "Western rGyalrongic" ([[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]]-[[Horpa language|Shangzhai|alias_match_article_entity]]) language.

[[Jackson Sun classifies Erkai|PERSON]] as a variety of sTodsde ([[Horpa language|Shangzhai|alias_match_article_entity]]).

*Western [[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]] is a tonal language scattered throughout several small areas of central and southern [[Nyagrong County|ORGANIZATION]] ([[Xinlong County|LOCATION]] 新龙县), [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Dkarmdzes|alias_match_single_candidate]] Prefecture.

Although speakers refer to themselves as Minyag (mə̀ɲá, mə̀ ɲó, etc.), Western [[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]] is not the same language as the Minyag or Muya language.

The Nyagrong Minyag (Western [[Horpa language|Horpa|alias_match_article_entity]]) language has also been documented by Van Way ([[2018|DATE]]).

Council of Assiniboia

The [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|annotation]] (Conseil d'Assiniboine) was, from [[1821|DATE]] until [[1870|DATE]], the [[first|ORDINAL]] appointed administrative body of [[the District of Assiniboia|ORGANIZATION]].

Over its existence, the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] transformed numerous times in an effort to bring law and order to a young colonial settlement that was rife with tension and hardship.

The District of [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] consisted of land that was in a [[50|NUMBER]] mile radius around Upper [[Fort Garry|PERSON]], including the [[Red River Colony|ORGANIZATION]] - which until [[his|PERSON]] death in [[1820|DATE]], was owned by [[Lord Selkirk|ORGANIZATION]].

Before [[1835|DATE]], the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] consisted of "a few councillors, to assist the Governor, [as well as] some few constables too, [that] had been nominally appointed; and [so] this little machinery of government had dragged along under what has been very properly called the smoothing system, or rather no system at all."

The [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] evolution happened in [[1835|DATE]], [[a year|DURATION]] after the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay Company|alias_match_match_candidate]] was officially granted ownership of the [[District of Assiniboia|ORGANIZATION]] from the Selkirk estate.

The Red River Settlement was divided into [[four|NUMBER]] separate districts, with a respective magistrate being delegated to each sector, as per [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] judicature.

Prior to [[1835|DATE]], the constabulary in the Red River Settlement was appointed by [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s councillors, and they were tasked with routine duties.

As stated by the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]], the goal was "every thing connected with the good order or discipline of the Corps be as much as possible in union with and conformable to the practice and usages connected with such service in the [[English Canadians|British|alias_match_single_candidate]] Army."

To further empower this new authority, it was requested by the Governor and the council that [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s military/police force be equipped with the guns and ammunition that was necessary to enforce both tranquility and respect.

In order to prevent the [[Volunteer Corps|ORGANIZATION]] from holding too much power, the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] enacted certain limitations for the force in order to publicly supervise them, such as the need for annual approval of their funding by the council.

In [[1836|DATE]], [[two|NUMBER]] changes occurred: [[first|ORDINAL]], the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] was made more representative, as the number of council members grew from [[5|NUMBER]] [[to|NUMBER]] [[15|NUMBER]]; and secondly, the tariff was lowered to [[5%|PERCENT]], and then [[4%|PERCENT]] [[the consecutive year|DATE]] as decided by officers in [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

With this came the creation of a governor-in-chief of [[Rupert|ORGANIZATION]]'s Land - [[George Simpson|George Simpson|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] - who overruled [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s Governor, and a newly appointed President of the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]].

Councils for both [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Rupert|ORGANIZATION]]'s Land were transformed in the new administration, as new members of council, such as governors, magistrates, councillors, and sheriffs arrived from [[London|London|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

It was [[1845|DATE]] when the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] completely disbanded the [[Volunteer Corps|ORGANIZATION]], and replaced it with [[15|NUMBER]] constables that had been appointed by the council.

During [[1869-1870|DURATION]], when [[Rupert|ORGANIZATION]]'s Land joined the newly confederated dominion of [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] was disbanded.

When [[Louis Riel|PERSON]] sought counsel with the [[Council of Assiniboia|Council of Assiniboia|alias_match_article_entity]] insisting that negotiations needed to be made with [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]], on behalf of the local [[Métis|PERSON]], [[Louis Riel|his|PERSON_coref]] demands were rejected.

In response [[Riel|PERSON]] created the council's successor, the short-lived Legislative Assembly of [[Council of Assiniboia|Assiniboia|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], soon followed by the [[Red River Rebellion|Red River Rebellion|annotation]].

After creating and distributing several of [[John Carradine|his|PERSON_coref]] own films, [[Jerry Warren|Warren|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] found that producing original features from scratch required entirely too much of an effort, so [[Jerry Warren|he|PERSON_coref]] began buying and distributing foreign-made films through [[Jerry Warren|his|PERSON_coref]] own distribution company, [[Associated Distributors Productions Inc.|ORGANIZATION]], or [[ADP|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Jerry Warren|His|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] such involved purchasing the Swedish science fiction film "[[Space Invasion of Lapland|Space Invasion of Lapland|annotation]]", and editing it into [[Jerry Warren|his|PERSON_coref]] own version re-titled "[[Space Invasion of Lapland|Invasion of the Animal People|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]".

"[[The Aztec Mummy|La Momia Azteca|annotation]]", a Mexican horror film, was heavily re-edited into [[Jerry Warren|his|PERSON_coref]] [[United States|U.S|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]. version "Attack of the Mayan Mummy", and footage from the same mummy film later found its way into [[Jerry Warren|Warren|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s "[[Face of the Screaming Werewolf|Face of the Screaming Werewolf|annotation]]", [[Jerry Warren|his|PERSON_coref]] re-edited version of the Mexican film "[[House of Terror (1960 film)|La Casa del Terror|annotation]]" which had starred [[Lon Chaney Jr.|Lon Chaney Jr.|annotation]]

The Mexican film "La Marca del Muerto" was edited into [[Jerry Warren|Warren|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s "[[Creature of the Walking Dead|Creature of the Walking Dead|annotation]]", followed by [[Jerry Warren|his|PERSON_coref]] "[[Curse of the Stone Hand|Curse of the Stone Hand|annotation]]" which [[Jerry Warren|he|PERSON_coref]] edited from [[two|NUMBER]] [[1940|DATE]]'s Chilean films that [[Jerry Warren|he|PERSON_coref]] had purchased, "La casa está vacía" and "La dama de la muerte"

Warren and [[Brianne Murphy|Murphy|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] met in [[1956|DATE]] while [[Jerry Warren|Warren|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was preparing to film "[[Man Beast (film)|Man Beast|alias_match_single_candidate]]" and they married in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas|annotation]], [[Nevada|Nevada|annotation]], after [[Jerry Warren|he|PERSON_coref]] finished [[Anchors Aweigh (film)|the film|non_person_coref]].

During the honeymoon, [[Jerry Warren|Warren|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote the script for "[[Teenage Zombies|Teenage Zombies|annotation]]" in [[less than a week|DURATION]].

Wolin (town)

[[Wolin (town)|Wolin|annotation]] ([[Wolin (town)|Wollin|alias_match_article_entity]]) is a town in northwestern [[Poland|Poland|annotation]], situated on the southern tip of the [[Wolin|Wolin|annotation]] island off the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic|annotation]] coast of the historic region of [[Pomerania|Pomerania|annotation]].

[[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]], [[now|DATE]] a fishing port and gateway to [[Wolin|the island|non_person_coref]]'s bathing resorts, has a population of approximately [[4,900|NUMBER]].

Dating from [[the 9th century|DATE]], it has been associated with the semi-legendary settlements of [[Jomsborg|Jomsburg|annotation]], [[Wolin (town)|Jumne|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Wolin (town)|Julin|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Vineta|Vineta|annotation]].

The ford across the river Dziwna on which [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] is located has been used as far back as the [[Stone Age|Stone Age|annotation]].

This emporium, by contemporary chronicles referred to as "[[Wolin (town)|Jumne|alias_match_article_entity]]" or "[[Wolin (town)|Julin|alias_match_article_entity]]", began to prosper in [[the 9th century|DATE]].

Later, [[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]] was mentioned in the chronicles of [[Adam of Bremen|Adam of Bremen|annotation]].

Though other towns are also considered possible locations of [[Vineta|Vineta|alias_match_match_candidate]], it is believed [[today|DATE]] to be identical with [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]].

Władysław Filipowiak however says that the battle "probably led to the establishment of the rule of the winner over [[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]]."

In [[1982|DATE]], [[Joachim Herrmann (CSU)|Joachim Herrmann|annotation]] suggested that [[Bolesław I the Brave|Boleslaw|alias_match_single_candidate]] had established a [[Vikings|Viking|annotation]] colony under [[Palnatoke|Palnatoki|annotation]] there to defend [[Bolesław I the Brave|his|PERSON_coref]] realm, a thesis that in [[2000|DATE]] had been revisited by [[Leszek Słupecki|PERSON]] who like Władysław Duczko ([[2000|DATE]]) called for further research on resident [[Vikings|Vikings|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[Jomsborg|Jomsborg|annotation]]/[[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]].

Filipowiak says that, based on the archaeological evidence, "there might actually have existed in [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] a mercenary company placed by the Piast rulers in the unruly town, which in [[1007|DATE]] informed the German Emperor that [[Bolesław I the Brave|Boleslaw the Brave|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] had been weaving a dangerous plot," but also points out the need for further research on this subject.

[[Oskar Eggert|PERSON]] and Filipowiak say that suggests that [[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]] was independent in its policies by that time.

Filipowiak further says that in [[the 11th century|DATE]], [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] became a "save haven for [[Vikings|Danish|alias_match_single_candidate]] refugees, which in that period led to inner unrest and conflicts as well as pirate activities."

Much of [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] was destroyed in [[1043|DATE]] by Dano-Norwegian King [[Magnus the Good|Magnus the Good|annotation]], who however failed to conquer its center.

In [[1121/22|DATE]], the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Polish duke|annotation]] [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław III Wrymouth|annotation]] conquered the area along with the [[Duchy of Pomerania|Duchy of Pomerania|annotation]] under [[Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania|Wartislaw I|annotation]]. [[Bolesław I the Brave|Boleslaw|alias_match_single_candidate]] aimed at [[Christianization of Pomerania|Christianizing the area|annotation]] and in [[1122|DATE]] sent the Spanish eremite [[Bernard|PERSON]] on a mission to [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]].

When [[Otto of Bamberg|Otto|alias_match_single_candidate]], a respected and wealthy man accompanied by German and [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Polish|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] clergymen and military units, arrived in [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Otto of Bamberg|he|PERSON_coref]] had already successfully converted the [[Pyrzyce|Pyritz|annotation]] and [[Kamień Pomorski|Cammin|annotation]] areas.

Yet, when [[Otto of Bamberg|Otto|alias_match_single_candidate]] after [[two month|DURATION]] work and threatening with another military intervention managed to convert [[Szczecin|Szczecin|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Otto of Bamberg|he|PERSON_coref]] returned to [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] and the [[Wolinians|Wolinians|alias_match_match_candidate]] accepted conversion.

While [[this second|DATE]] mission was oriented more towards [[Western Pomerania|Western Pomerania|annotation]], [[Otto of Bamberg|Otto|alias_match_single_candidate]] also visited [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] again.

In [[1140|DATE]], [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] was made the first episcopal see in Pomerania: [[Pope Innocent II|Pope Innocent II|annotation]] founded [[Bishopric of Cammin|the diocese|non_person_coref]] by a papal bull of [[14 October|DATE]], and made [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]]'s church of "[[St. Adalbert|LOCATION]]" its see.

At the same time [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] economically decayed and was devastated by [[Vikings|Danish|alias_match_single_candidate]] expeditions, which contributed to the move of the episkopal see to [[Grobe|PERSON]].

The [[Vikings|Danish|alias_match_single_candidate]] campaigns completely wiped out [[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]] in [[the late 12th century|DATE]].

[[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]] remained in the [[Duchy of Pomerania|Duchy of Pomerania|annotation]] (which was a vassal of [[Denmark|Denmark|annotation]] from [[1185|DATE]], and afterwards was within the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire|annotation]] since [[1227|DATE]]), passing with [[Duchy of Pomerania|the duchy|non_person_coref]] to the [[Swedish Pomerania|Swedish Crown|annotation]] following the [[Treaty of Stettin (1630)|Treaty of Stettin (1630)|annotation]], the [[Peace of Westphalia|Peace of Westphalia|annotation]] ([[1648|DATE]]) and the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)|Treaty of Stettin (1653)|annotation]].

[[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]] subsequently became part of the [[German Empire|German Empire|annotation]] in [[1871|DATE]], then its successor states the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Republic|annotation]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich|annotation]].

In [[1945|DATE]], with the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Wolin (town)|Wollin|alias_match_article_entity]] was conquered by the [[Red Army|Red Army|annotation]] and handed over to [[Poland|Poland|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[Nazi Germany|German|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] population was expelled in accordance to the [[Potsdam Agreement|Potsdam Agreement|annotation]].

[[Wolin (town)|the town|non_person_coref]] was [[once|DATE]] again named [[Wolin (town)|Wolin|alias_match_article_entity]] and resettled by [[Poles|Poles|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Griphobilharzia amoena

"[[Griphobilharzia amoena|Griphobilharzia amoena|alias_match_article_entity]]" are dioecious and are found in the circulatory system of their definitive host, "Crocodylus johnstoni".

The notion that "[[Griphobilharzia amoena|Griphobilharzia amoena|alias_match_article_entity]]" is the only schistosome found in a cold-blooded animal (crocodile), leads to the hypothesis that perhaps "[[Griphobilharzia amoena|Griphobilharzia amoena|alias_match_article_entity]]" and other schistosomes are based in ectothermic archosaurs.

It was also predicted that since "[[Griphobilharzia amoena|Griphobilharzia amoena|alias_match_article_entity]]" originated in ectotherms and then inhabited endothermic avian species, which is where they exist [[today|DATE]].

However, upon analysis it was discovered that "[[Griphobilharzia amoena|Griphobilharzia amoena|alias_match_article_entity]]" is actually more closely related to spirorchiids from freshwater turtles rather than to schistosomes.

Klara Rumyanova

[[Klara Rumyanova|Klara Mikhailovna Rumyanova|annotation]] (Кла́ра Миха́йловна Румя́нова; [[8 December 1929|DATE]], [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad|annotation]] – [[18 September 2004|DATE]], [[Moscow|Moscow|LOCATION_popular_entity]]) was a Soviet and Russian actress and singer.

[[Klara Rumyanova|She|PERSON_coref]] was active from [[1951|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1999|DATE]].

[[Klara Rumyanova|Her|PERSON_coref]] childlike and endearing voice was easily recognized by generations of Soviet people from their early childhood, because [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] voiced numerous Russian animated films and sang countless children's songs.

After the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|LOCATION_popular_entity]] [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] songs have been heard even more, because of numerous releases of compact discs and tapes of children's songs from cartoons of the "[[Soyuzmultfilm|Soyuzmultfilm|annotation]]" studio.

[[Klara Rumyanova|She|PERSON_coref]] played roles in several films.

[[Klara Rumyanova|Klara Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] was born on [[8 December 1929|DATE]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad|annotation]].

In [[1947|DATE]], [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] moved to [[Moscow|Moscow|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and on the [[first|ORDINAL]] attempt [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] entered [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK|annotation]], where [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] studied at the course of [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov|annotation]] and [[Tamara Makarova|PERSON]].

In childhood and adolescence, [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had a completely different voice, a contralto.

The ability to speak with [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] famous children's voice, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] found only in [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] student [[years|DURATION]] after a serious illness.

[[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], like all the students of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], toured with concerts on the [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow Oblast|annotation]] and [[once|DATE]] [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] was very cold and almost died of croupous inflammation of the lungs.

After lying in the hospital for [[more than a month|DURATION]], [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] lost [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] voice.

[[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov|alias_match_single_candidate]] showed [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] to a phoniatrician, but [[he|PERSON]] explained that [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] has very rare vocal cords and [[he|PERSON]] does not guarantee that [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] will be able to properly practice vocal after recovery.

For half [[a year|DURATION]] [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Gerasimov|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] forbade [[Klara Rumyanova|Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] to talk even in a whisper, and they communicated through writing.

When [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] voice recovered, [[Klara Rumyanova|Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] suddenly discovered that [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] could [[now|DATE]] speak in a very high voice, which came to be familiar to millions of moviegoers.

In [[1953|DATE]], [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] graduated from [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and became an actress of the [[National Film Actors|ORGANIZATION]]' Theatre.

As a student [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] started acting in film, [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] cinematic debut took place as an episodic role in the film "The Rural Doctor" ([[1951|DATE]]), by the same [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Gerasimov|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]].

However, in [[the future|DATE]] [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] played only supporting or episodic roles, never playing the main ones.

[[Klara Rumyanova|Her|PERSON_coref]] notable roles were in the films "The Rural Doctor" ([[Lena|PERSON]]), "They Were the [[First|ORDINAL]]" (Varya), "[[Four|NUMBER]]" (nurse), "Life [[first|ORDINAL]]" (Zoya), "[[Resurrection (1960 film)|Resurrection|annotation]]" (Bogodukhovskaya), "[[Time, Forward!|Time, Forward!|annotation]]"

For [[six years|DURATION]] (from [[1965|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1970|DATE]]), [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] did not act in film at all, until the Minister of Culture [[Ekaterina Furtseva|PERSON]] dismissed [[Ivan Pyryev|Pyryev|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] from the post of the general director.

[[A year|DURATION]] before [[his|PERSON]] death, [[Ivan Pyryev|Pyryev|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] phoned [[Klara Rumyanova|Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] and apologized to [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] for [[his|PERSON]] behavior.

For the [[first|ORDINAL]] time, [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] applied [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] "children's" voice in [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] debut film "The Rural Doctor", where [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] played a woman in childbirth.

Then [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] volunteered herself on the set to voice the scene.

After that, [[Klara Rumyanova|Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] secretly became famous at the whole [[Mosfilm|Mosfilm|annotation]], as an actress, able to scream in any child's voice, so that, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] combined acting in film and voicing, where [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] voice was often used for young children.

Then [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] began to receive the [[first|ORDINAL]] invitations from the film studio [[Soyuzmultfilm|Soyuzmultfilm|annotation]], but [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] rejected them, considering [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] acting potential as higher than merely voicing cartoons.

However, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] was rarely invited to act in feature films which eventually forced [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] to do voice work.

[[Klara Rumyanova|Her|PERSON_coref]] debut in animation was the cartoon "The Wonderful Garden" ([[1962|DATE]]).

Gradually during this period, [[Klara Rumyanova|Klara|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] began to cooperate more actively with [[Soyuzmultfilm|Soyuzmultfilm|alias_match_match_candidate]], and as a result, at a time when [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] was no longer shooting, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] became very popular as an actress and began to record on the radio and perform on the stage with children's songs and romances.

[[Klara Rumyanova|Klara Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] became the only actress of the [[Soviet Union|USSR|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]], awarded the honorary title "Honored Artist of the RSFSR" for [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] work in animation.

Despite this, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] was very worried because [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] could not play in live action films, because [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] always considered herself a dramatic actress.

After the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and the subsequent economic crisis, [[Klara Rumyanova|Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]], like many actors, gradually became unemployed ([[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] was dismissed from the National Film Actors' Theatre) and only occasionally took part in the recording of audio and audio concerts and the production of radio plays.

However, even during this period, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] was very selective – the general director of the studio "VOX-Records" Viktor Truhan recalled that [[Klara Rumyanova|Rumyanova|alias_match_article_entity]] basically refused to record for audio advertising.

Without work, [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] wrote several plays, in [[2000|DATE]] [[Klara Rumyanova|she|PERSON_coref]] published the book "My Name is a Woman" – an author's collection of [[Klara Rumyanova|her|PERSON_coref]] plays about significant female characters of Russian history ([[Nadezhda Durova|Nadezhda Durova|annotation]], [[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova|Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova|annotation]], [[Evdokiya Rostopchina|ORGANIZATION]]).

Mont Blanc massif

The [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|annotation]] ([[Mont Blanc massif|Massif du Mont-Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]]; [[Mont Blanc massif|Massiccio del Monte Bianco|alias_match_article_entity]]) is a mountain range in the [[Alps|Alps|annotation]], located mostly in [[France|France|annotation]] and [[Italy|Italy|annotation]], but also straddling [[Switzerland|Switzerland|annotation]] at its northeastern end.

Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[first|ORDINAL]] climbed in [[1786|DATE]], marking the start of the sport of mountaineering.

Access into [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s is facilitated by cable cars, mountain railways and mountain huts which offer [[overnight|TIME]] refuge to climbers and skiers.

The [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[46|NUMBER]] km long and lies in a southwest to northeasterly direction across the borders of [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Haute-Savoie|Haute-Savoie|annotation]] and [[Savoie|Savoie|annotation]]), [[Italy|Italy|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Aosta Valley|Aosta Valley|annotation]]) and [[Switzerland|Switzerland|alias_match_match_candidate]] (western [[Valais|Valais|annotation]]).

Crowning the massif is [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[4808|NUMBER]] m), the highest mountain in the [[Alps|Alps|alias_match_match_candidate]] and in western [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]].

From the summit of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] to the [[Arve|LOCATION]] near [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] there is a [[3800|NUMBER]] m drop in altitude over a distance of just [[8|NUMBER]] km.

The summit of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] is an ice cap whose thickness varies from [[year|DURATION]] [[to|DURATION]] [[year|DURATION]].

The main mountain passes, or cols, that connect different valleys and towns around the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] are:

The [[first|ORDINAL]] ascent of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[1786|DATE]] by [[Jacques Balmat|Jacques Balmat|annotation]] and [[Michel Paccard|PERSON]] initiated the sport of alpine mountaineering, and it was during the golden age of alpinism ([[185465|NUMBER]]) and the silver age of alpinism ([[186582|NUMBER]]) that the majority of the main summits of the massif were [[first|ORDINAL]] attained.

A wide range of glaciers and glacial structures can be found across the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]], all of which can be easily reached or viewed.

Whilst these glaciers appear to show similar fluctuations in length, research shows that each glacier of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] has its own individual and distinctive response time to changes in snowfall and climate.

[[Italy|It|alias_match_single_candidate]] released [[200000|NUMBER]] m3 of water and ice which flowed down [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]side, killing [[175|NUMBER]] people in [[Saint-Gervais-les-Bains|Saint-Gervais|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The [[first|ORDINAL]] recorded account of a body reappearing from a glacier in the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] range was made by [[Viscount Edmond de Catelin|PERSON]] in [[1861|DATE]].

[[Italy|It|alias_match_single_candidate]] concerned [[three|NUMBER]] alpine guides who were buried in a crevasse during an avalanche on [[20 August 1820|DATE]] near the [[Rocher Rouges|PERSON]], high up on [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]], during an expedition organised by .

. These occurred at almost identical locations high up near the summit of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]]: [[one|NUMBER]] in [[1950|DATE]] ([[Air India Flight 245|Air India Flight 245|annotation]]), and [[one|NUMBER]] in [[1966|DATE]] ([[Air India Flight 101|Air India Flight 101|annotation]]). Debris from these crashes is still commonly found on [[Tête Rousse Glacier|the glacier|non_person_coref]] below.

The [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] consists predominantly of ancient granite rocks.

Granite intrusions and associated metamorphic rocks formed the base of [[Alps|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s we [[now|DATE]] call the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] as well as the nearby [[Aiguilles Rouges|Aiguilles Rouges|annotation]].

Both the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]], and the [[Aiguilles Rouges|Aiguilles Rouges|alias_match_match_candidate]] range to its north, [[now|DATE]] form part of the external zone of the [[Alps|Alps|alias_match_match_candidate]], effectively being the outermost layers of rock.

The central granites make up [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]], the steep slopes of the [[Aiguille du Dru|Drus|annotation]], the [[Grandes Jorasses|Grandes Jorasses|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[Dent du Géant|Dent du Géant|alias_match_match_candidate]], and at the highest points are topped by schists, which are visible in places such as Grands Montets and near [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]]'s summit.

During [[the mid-19th century|DATE]] the granite of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] was an important source of stone for buildings; [[one hundred|NUMBER]] [[Italy|Italian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] stonemasons were brought to the [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] valley by [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert of Sardinia|annotation]] for reconstructing the towns of [[Sallanches|Sallanches|annotation]] and [[Cluses|Cluses|annotation]], both of which had at that time just been destroyed by fires.

[[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]eer and explorer, [[Edward Whymper|Edward Whymper|annotation]], noted that the basin of the [[Glacier de Talèfre|ORGANIZATION]] was "considered good hunting-ground for crystals", and that the slopes below les Courtes had yielded many large specimens.

The [[first|ORDINAL]] systematic account of the minerals of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] area was published in [[1873|DATE]] by [[Venance Payot|ORGANIZATION]].

If these are excluded, it is known [[today|DATE]] that at least [[68|NUMBER]] separate mineral species occur across the whole range of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]].

In order to preserve the mineralogical heritage of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]], in [[2008|DATE]] the commune of [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] banned all mineral-hunting activities and collection of specimens without a prior permit being issued by the mayor's office.

Located on the watershed between the [[Rhône|Rhône|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[Po (river)|Po|annotation]], the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] is also situated between the [[two|NUMBER]] different climatic regions of the northern and western [[Alps|Alps|alias_match_match_candidate]] and that of the southern [[Alps|Alps|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The climate of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] is cold and temperate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate classification|annotation]] "[[Köppen climate classification|Cfb|alias_match_single_candidate]]"), and is greatly influenced by altitude.

The best weather for mountaineering or hiking occurs between [[late June|DATE]] to [[early October|DATE]] but, being the highest part of the [[Alps|Alps|alias_match_match_candidate]], the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] can create its own weather patterns.

Temperatures drop as [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s gain in height, and the summit of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] is a permanent ice cap, with temperatures around [[-20|NUMBER]] C.

However, at an even higher altitude (near to the summit of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]]) precipitation is considerably less, with only around [[1100|DATE]] mm recorded, despite the latter measurements being taken at a height of [[4300|DATE]] m.

In [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s further south of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] range, annual precipitation is significantly less than at equivalent altitudes within the massif.

Whilst the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] does not contain any species that are endemic to it, there are many rare and legally protected s

Early explorers, such as [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander von Humboldt|annotation]] in [[1807|DATE]], observed a number of notable species in [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s around [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] at altitudes above [[3100|NUMBER]] m.

In the mid [[1800s|DATE]], [[Venance Payot|Venance Payot|annotation]], a [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] naturalist, published a number of articles on the flora around the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] area, including a list of the flowering plants, ferns mosses and lichens found at les Grands Mulets and elsewhere in the massif around [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[Aosta Valley|Aosta Valley|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The botanical garden derives its name from the genus of mountain flowers, "[[Saussurea|Saussurea|annotation]]" (Saw-worts) which itself was named after [[Horace Bénédict de Saussure|Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|annotation]], whose enthusiasm for scientific research in [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s led to the [[first|ORDINAL]] ascent of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[1786|DATE]].

[[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s around [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] are home to many mammal species, including ibex, chamois, deer, mountain hare and alpine marmot (including a small population of albino marmots within [[Val Ferret|ORGANIZATION]]).

[[Eurasian lynx|Eurasian lynx|annotation]] have been reintroduced into the [[France|French|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Alps|Alps|alias_match_match_candidate]] and, although [[present|DATE]] around the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]], are extremely unlikely to be encountered.

The following birds have been recorded in different habitats right across the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]]:

[[Aosta Valley|the region|non_person_coref]] in which the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] is located has been occupied by humans for [[at least 70,000 years|DURATION]], although, as [[now|DATE]]—and because of the great height and glaciated nature of [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s—only the lower parts of the valleys around its perimeter would have been inhabited or used as routes of communication.

They gave the name "[[Alps|Alpes|alias_match_single_candidate]] Penninae", or "Poeninae", to the highest parts of the Alpswhich extended from [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Monte Rosa|Monte Rosa|annotation]].

For many [[centuries|DURATION]] thereafter, the settlements around the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats.

The descriptions of their exploits were published across [[Europe|Europe|alias_match_popular_entity]], bringing [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] range to the attention of a wide audience for the [[first|ORDINAL]] time.

In [[1760|DATE]], [[Horace Bénédict de Saussure|Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] offered a large financial prize to the [[first|ORDINAL]] people who successfully ascended [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[The decades|DURATION]] that followed saw the gradual opening up of [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] to the world, as well as the rest of the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]].

The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]] range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit to marvel at the "[[Mer de Glace|Sea of Ice|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]" (the [[Mer de Glace|Mer de Glace|alias_match_match_candidate]]) became a fashionable thing to experience.

In [[1849|DATE]], [[John Ruskin|John Ruskin|annotation]] spent [[a month|DURATION]] in [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]], from where [[John Ruskin|he|PERSON_coref]] painted some of the massif's mountains before undertaking the Tour of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]].

In just [[50 years|DURATION]] the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]], and [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Courmayeur|Courmayeur|alias_match_match_candidate]] in particular, had become a popular destination for many travellers, and its economy changed from [[80%|PERCENT]] agriculture to [[80%|PERCENT]] tourism.

In [[1906|DATE]], the [[eleventh|ORDINAL]] edition of a guidebook written by [[Edward Whymper|Edward Whymper|alias_match_match_candidate]] about [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] range estimated that [[130,000|NUMBER]] visitors had gone there during the previous season.

The tourist boom to [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s had started.

The [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[now|DATE]] a significant tourist destination.

Some surveys have shown that tourists mostly come to the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] and its environs for [[winter|DATE]] sports such as skiing as well as [[summer|DATE]] outdoor activities like hiking, climbing and cycling.

The [[Aiguille du Midi Cable|ORGANIZATION]] Car in [[Chamonix|Chamonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] attracts [[500,000|NUMBER]] people [[each year|SET]] and gives views over much of the massif, and up towards [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] itself.

Other recent enhancements to tourist infrastructure across the massif have included construction of a new, and ultra-modern [[Goûter Hut|Goûter Hut|annotation]] to accommodate the increasing numbers of mountaineers attempting the popular [[Goûter Route|Goûter Route|annotation]] to the summit of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]], and investment of [[½ billion euros|MONEY]] in [[Les Grands Montets|ORGANIZATION]] and other ski areas over a [[six-year|DURATION]] period from [[2014|DATE]] onwards.

Increasing numbers of mountain tourists, ease of access into the high mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] to people with little or no previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued.

With up to [[30,000|NUMBER]] climbing parties [[now|DATE]] attempting to ascend [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] [[each year|SET]], it has gained the reputation of being [[one|NUMBER]] of the world's deadliest mountains.

Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] average almost [[100|NUMBER]] [[a year|DURATION]], with the majority occurring on [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] itself.

. In [[recent years|DURATION]], guards have been placed on the most popular route of ascent to [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]]'s summit at peak periods in order to ensure that those entering [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]] environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]]s to be treated with greater respect.

The [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] has provided numerous opportunities for academic research, dating back to the very [[first|ORDINAL]] ascent of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[1786|DATE]] during which [[Michel Paccard|PERSON]] carried scientific equipment to confirm it as the highest summit.

In [[1890|DATE]], [[Joseph Vallot|PERSON]] built a small meteorological observatory at approximately [[4350|DATE]] m between the [[Dôme du Goûter|ORGANIZATION]] and [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]]'s summit from where numerous measurements and scientific experiments were conducted.

In [[1893|DATE]], [[Pierre Janssen|Pierre Janssen|annotation]] constructed an astronomical observatory on the top of [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc|alias_match_article_entity]], partially buried within the summit ice to hold it in place.

[[Seven|NUMBER]] sites in the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] were selected, with the [[Tour Ronde|Tour Ronde|annotation]] being the [[first|ORDINAL]] to be analysed.

This would formerly have held [[Mont Blanc massif|the mountain|non_person_coref]] together more effectively, but it is [[now|DATE]] exposed to greater weathering through the freeze-thaw cycle of water, with maximum occurrence during warm [[summers|SET]].

In [[the 1930s|DATE]], during a period of increased international tension, the [[Mont Blanc massif|Mont Blanc massif|alias_match_article_entity]] was used by both countries wanting to demonstrate their military might, and large drills and troop exercises were undertaken at high altitude.

Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation

The [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|annotation]] ([[Italian language|Italian|annotation]]: "[[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Ordine Supremo della Santissima Annunziata|alias_match_article_entity]]") is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic|annotation]] order of knighthood, originating in [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy|annotation]].

[[Today|DATE]], [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] continues as a dynastic order under the jurisdiction of the Head of the [[House of Savoy|House of Savoy|annotation]], [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (born 1943)|Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta|annotation]], who is [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]]'s hereditary Sovereign and Grand Master.

The origins of the [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|alias_match_article_entity]] begins in [[1362|DATE]], when [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy|Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy|annotation]] ([[1343-1383|DURATION]]) instituted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]]'s earliest designation, under the title of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Order of the Collar|alias_match_article_entity]].

Even at this time, [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] was dedicated to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary|PERSON_popular_redirect]], who is celebrated as "Our Lady of the Annunciation."

Thus, [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] is a dynastic religious (or [[Catholic Church|Catholic|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) order of chivalry.

Under its [[first|ORDINAL]] formulation, [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] had [[fifteen|NUMBER]] knights.

The number was symbolic of the number of daily masses celebrated with [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]].

In [[1409|DATE]], [[Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy|Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy|annotation]], gave [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] its [[first|ORDINAL]] known statutes, and in [[1434|DATE]], [[Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy|he|PERSON_coref]] extended [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] to [[five|NUMBER]] more knights.

The most recent took place on [[11 June 1985|DATE]] by [[Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples|HRH Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples|annotation]] and hereditary Grand Master of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]].

Most importantly, [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]]'s name was changed to its [[current|DATE]] name, The Most Holy [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Order of the Annunciation|alias_match_article_entity]].

The badge of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] was also changed, with the representation of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] being added.

[[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]], throughout its early history and following the reforms of [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III|annotation]], was awarded for supreme recognition of distinguished services.

[[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] constituted a kind of religious and military fraternity between the Sovereign Head of the [[Order (distinction)|Order|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|his|PERSON_coref]] companions; it was reserved exclusively to distinguished men-at-arms who, apart from exemplary service, had to be of illustrious birth, particularly of catholic and noble birth.

[[Today|DATE]], [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] holds the following other regulations:

occasions, a non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] may be awarded [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]]. However, they may only be honorary members of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]].

[[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] has only [[one|NUMBER]] class, i.e. "[[Order (distinction)|Knight|alias_match_single_candidate]]".

The full [[Italian language|Italian|alias_match_single_candidate]] title is "Cavaliere dell'[[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Ordine Supremo della Santissima Annunziata|alias_match_article_entity]]".

Although [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] has only [[one|NUMBER]] class, it has [[two|NUMBER]] sets of insignia, the "Piccola Collana" and the "Grande Collana".

The primary and oldest insignia of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] is its collar.

Some have also suggested that the letters are actually the [[third|ORDINAL]] person singular of the [[present|DATE]] indicative tense of the [[Latin|Latin|alias_match_popular_entity]] verb "ferre", which would indicate that [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] is supported by the bond of faith sworn to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]].

The star of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]], which was [[first|ORDINAL]] used in [[1680|DATE]] by specifications of the Royal Lady [[Maria Giovana Battista|PERSON]], Duchess Regent of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], is of gold and also has a representation of the Annunciation in a medallion in the center which is set within a gold cross of [[four|NUMBER]] pommels.

The insignia of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] has the following regulations:

When [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] is not worn, Knights may wear a gold miniature of the badge (medallion of the collar) of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] suspended from a red ribbon.

They may also wear either a ribbon-bar (upon a uniform) or a rosette (upon a suit), both of which are red and have a miniature cross of [[four|NUMBER]] pommels engraved with the [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Annunciation|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

er (distinction)|Order|alias_match_single_candidate]], the Grand Chancellor of the [[Order (distinction)|Order|alias_match_single_candidate]], the Council of the [[Order (distinction)|Order|alias_match_single_candidate]], Members, and the [[Giunta|PERSON]] of the [[Order (distinction)|Order|alias_match_single_candidate]]. The following are some of those that make up the "Grand Magisterium" of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]].

Among the notable recipients of [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|the order|non_person_coref]] of the [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Annunciation|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], [[House of Savoy|King|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Amanullah Khan|Amanullah|annotation]] of Afghanistan (reigned [[1919-1929|DURATION]]) should probably be mentioned, especially since [[Amanullah Khan|he|PERSON_coref]] was not a [[Christians|Christian|alias_match_popular_redirect]].

As a result of [[Lord Kitchener|LOCATION]]'s visit to [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[1910|DATE]], slight alterations were made—chiefly affecting the general and administrative staffs, and which included the establishment of the [[New Zealand Staff Corps|New Zealand Staff Corps|annotation]]—and the scheme was set in motion in [[January, 1911|DATE]].

In [[World War I|World War I|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] sent the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force|New Zealand Expeditionary Force|annotation]] ([[New Zealand Expeditionary Force|NZEF|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]), of soldiers who fought with Australians as the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|annotation]] at [[Gallipoli|Gallipoli|annotation]], subsequently immortalised as "[[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZACs|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]".

After Major General [[Godley|PERSON]] departed with the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force|NZEF|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[October 1914|DATE]], Major General [[Alfred Robin|Alfred William Robin|annotation]] commanded [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Military Forces|alias_match_article_entity]] at home throughout [[World War I|the war|non_person_coref]], as commandant.

The total number of [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand troops|alias_match_article_entity]] and nurses to serve overseas in [[1914|DATE]]–[[1918|DATE]], excluding those in British and other dominion forces, was [[100,000|NUMBER]], from a population of just over a [[million|NUMBER]].

Approximately a further [[thousand|NUMBER]] men died within [[five years|DURATION]] of [[World War I|the war|non_person_coref]]'s end, as a result of injuries sustained, and [[507|NUMBER]] died whilst training in [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] between [[1914|DATE]] [[and|DATE]] [[1918|DATE]].

[[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] had [[one|NUMBER]] of the highest casualty—and death—rates per capita of any country involved in [[World War I|the war|non_person_coref]].

As part of the preparations for the possible outbreak of war in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific|LOCATION_popular_redirect]], the defensive forces stationed in [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] were expanded in [[late 1941|DATE]].

On [[1 November|DATE]], [[three|NUMBER]] new brigade headquarters were raised (taking the total in the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[seven|NUMBER]]), and [[three|NUMBER]] divisional headquarters were established to coordinate [[Z Special Unit|the unit|non_person_coref]]s located in the [[Northern|ORGANIZATION]], [[Central and Southern Military Districts|ORGANIZATION]].

The forces stationed in [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] were considerably reduced as the threat of invasion passed.

The [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] government ordered a general stand-down of the defensive forces in [[Japan|the country|non_person_coref]] on [[28 June|DATE]], which led to further reductions in the strength of units and a lower state of readiness.

In addition, the 1st [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Tank Brigade ([[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]]) was also active for a time.

The [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] was formally formed from the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Military Forces|alias_match_article_entity]] following the [[Second Boer War|Second|alias_match_single_candidate]] World [[Iraq War|War|alias_match_multiple_candidates]].

The [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Act [[1950|DATE]] stipulated that the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]]

would consist from then on of [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Troops (army headquarters, [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Schools, and base units); District Troops ([[Northern Military District|ORGANIZATION]], [[Central and Southern Military Districts|ORGANIZATION]], the [[12|NUMBER]] subordinate area HQs, elementary training elements, coastal artillery and composite AA regiments); and the [[New Zealand Division|New Zealand Division|alias_match_match_candidate]], the mobile striking force. [[New Zealand Division|the division|non_person_coref]] was alternatively known as '3NZEF'.

The [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] combat after the [[Second Boer War|Second|alias_match_single_candidate]] World [[Iraq War|War|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] was in the [[New Zealand in the Korean War|Korean War|annotation]], which began with [[North Korea|North Korea|LOCATION_popular_entity]]'s invasion of the South on [[25 June 1950|DATE]].

[[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery|annotation]] and support elements arrived later during [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|the conflict|non_person_coref]] from [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]].

The majority of [[New Zealand in the Korean War|Kayforce|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] had returned to [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] by [[1955|DATE]], though it was not until [[1957|DATE]] that the last [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] soldiers had left [[Korea|Korea|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Through [[the 1950s|DATE]], [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] forces were deployed to the [[Malayan Emergency|Malayan Emergency|annotation]], and the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Confrontation with Indonesia|annotation]].

A [[Special Air Service|Special Air Service|annotation]] squadron was raised for this commitment, but most forces came from the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] infantry battalion in the [[Malaysia|Malaysia|alias_match_popular_entity]]–[[Singapore|Singapore|LOCATION_popular_entity]] area.

[[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] sent troops to the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam War|annotation]] in [[1964|DATE]] because of [[Cold War|Cold War|annotation]] concerns and alliance considerations.

Initial contributions were a [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] team of non-combat army engineers in [[1964|DATE]] followed by a battery from the [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|Royal New Zealand Artillery|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[1965|DATE]] which served initially with the Americans until the formation of the [[1st Australian Task Force|ORGANIZATION]] in [[1966|DATE]].

Some also served with the Australian and [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Training teams until [[1972|DATE]].

[[New Zealand|NZ|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] [[Special Air Service|SAS|alias_match_single_candidate]] arrived in [[1968|DATE]] and served with the Australian [[Special Air Service|SAS|alias_match_single_candidate]] until the Australian and [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] troop withdrawal in [[1971|DATE]].

Members from various branches of the [[New Zealand Army|NZ Army|alias_match_article_entity]] also served with U.S and Australian air and cavalry detachments as well as in intelligence, medical, and engineering.

In [[1978|DATE]], a national museum for the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]], the [[National Army Museum (New Zealand)|QEII Army Memorial Museum|annotation]], was built at [[Waiouru|Waiouru|annotation]], the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]]'s main training base in the central [[North Island|North Island|annotation]].

After the [[1983|DATE]] [[Defence Review|ORGANIZATION]], the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]]'s command structure was adjusted to distinguish more clearly the separate roles of operations and base support training.

There was an internal reorganisation within the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] General Staff, and [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] Land [[New Zealand Defence Force|Forces|alias_match_single_candidate]] Command in [[Takapuna|LOCATION]] was split into a [[Canadian Army|Land Force Command|ORGANIZATION_redirect_candidate]] and a Support Command.

[[Support Command (New Zealand)|Support Command|annotation]] which from then on comprised [[three|NUMBER]] elements, the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Training Group in [[Waiouru|Waiouru|alias_match_match_candidate]], the [[Force Maintenance Group|Force Maintenance Group|acronym_entity]] ([[Force Maintenance Group|FMG|acronym]]) based in Linton, and [[Base Area Wellington|Base Area Wellington|acronym_entity]] ([[Base Area Wellington|BAW|acronym]]) based in Trentham, assumed responsibility for individual training, [[third|ORDINAL]] line logistics and base support.

The [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] was prepared to field a [[Ready Reaction Force|ORGANIZATION]] which was a battalion group based on [[Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment|2/1 RNZIR|alias_match_single_candidate]]; the [[Integrated Expansion Force|ORGANIZATION]] ([[17|NUMBER]] units) brigade sized, which would be able to follow up [[90 days|DURATION]] after mobilization; and a [[Force Maintenance Group|ORGANIZATION]] of [[19|NUMBER]] units to provide logistical support to both forces.

During the later part of [[the 20th century|DATE]], [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] personnel served in a large number of [[United Nations|UN|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and other peacekeeping deployments including:

[[February 2006|DATE]] had to be cancelled when the [[United States Department of State|US State Department|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] refused permission for [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] to sell the [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113s|alias_match_single_candidate]] under a contract made when [[M113 armored personnel carrier|the vehicle|non_person_coref]]s were initially purchased

. The replacement of the [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113s|alias_match_single_candidate]] with the General Motors [[LAV (armoured vehicle)|LAV|alias_match_single_candidate]] III ([[LAV (armoured vehicle)|NZLAV|annotation]]) led to a review in [[2001|DATE]] on the purchase decision-making by [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]]'s auditor-general. The review found shortcomings in the defence acquisition process, but not in the eventual vehicle selection.

[[New Zealand Army|NZ Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Day is celebrated on [[25 March|DATE]], the anniversary of [[the day in 1845|DATE]] when the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] Legislative Council passed the [[first|ORDINAL]] Militia Act on [[25 March 1845|DATE]] constituting the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Anzac Day|ANZAC Day|annotation]] is the main annual commemorative activity for [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] soldiers.

On [[Anzac Day|25 April|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[each year|DATE]] the landings at [[Gallipoli|Gallipoli|alias_match_match_candidate]] are remembered, though [[the day|DATE]] has come to mean remembering the fallen from all wars in which [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] has been involved.

While a [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] public holiday, it is a duty [[day|DURATION]] for [[New Zealand Defence Force|New Zealand military personnel|alias_match_single_candidate]], who, even if not involved in official commemorative activities are required to attend an [[Anzac Day|ANZAC Day|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Dawn Parade in ceremonial uniform in their home location.

The various regiments of the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] mark their own [[Corps Days|ORGANIZATION]], many of which are derived from those of the corresponding British regiments.

Examples are [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai Day|annotation]] [[on 20 November|DATE]] for the Royal [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] Armoured Corps, [[St Barbara|ORGANIZATION]]'s [[Day on 4 December|DATE]] for the [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] [[currently|DATE]] has personnel deployed in these locations:

* [[Iraq|Iraq|annotation]] – Over [[100|NUMBER]] in a non-combat training mission to build the capacity of the [[Iraq|Iraqi|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] security forces working alongside the Australian [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] based at [[Taji|LOCATION]] since [[2015|DATE]] as part of [[Operation Okra|Operation Okra|annotation]].

* [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan|annotation]] – Mentoring at the [[Afghanistan|Afghan|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] National [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Officer Training Academy.

The [[New Zealand|NZ|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Provincial Reconstruction Team ([[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]]) ([[New Zealand|NZ|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] PRT), ended in [[April 2013|DATE]].

Like all Commonwealth countries uniforms of the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] had historically followed those of the [[Uniforms of the British Army|British Army|annotation]].

After initially serving with the U.S [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]], [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] forces in [[Vietnam|Vietnam|alias_match_popular_entity]] were amalgamated into the [[1st Australian Task Force|ORGANIZATION]] in [[1966|DATE]] and adopted Australian Jungle Greens ("JGs") from [[1967|DATE]].

Uniforms were initially supplied from 1ATF stocks but were eventually made in [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]].

The Australian JGs underwent some modifications to resemble U.S fatigues in [[1968|DATE]] and these new uniforms, nicknamed "pixie suits" (for the slant of the shirt pockets) were worn by [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Australian Army|Australian troops|alias_match_popular_redirect]] until the end of [[Vietnam War|the war|non_person_coref]].

Jungle Greens continued to be used as field wear by the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] throughout [[the 1970s|DATE]] until the introduction of Military camouflage in [[1980|DATE]] and a return to British-style field uniforms.

[[Disruptive Pattern Camouflage Uniform|British DPM|annotation]] was adopted in [[1980|DATE]] as the camouflage pattern for clothing, the colours of which were further modified several times to better suit [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] conditions.

Reforms in [[1997|DATE]] saw British-influenced modifications to the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] combat uniform.

The high crowned Campaign hat, nicknamed the "lemon squeezer" in [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]], was for [[decades|DURATION]] the most visible national distinction.

This was adopted by the [[Wellington Regiment|Wellington Regiment|annotation]] [[about 1911|DATE]] and became general issue for all [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] units during the latter stages of [[World War I|World War I|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] forces also used the U.S PASGT helmet until [[2009|DATE]] after which the Australian Enhanced Combat Helmet became the standard issue helmet until [[2019|DATE]].

In [[2003|DATE]] a desert [[DPM|ORGANIZATION]] pattern, also based on the British pattern was in use with [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] peacekeeping forces in [[Iraq|Iraq|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Africa|Africa|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[2012|DATE]] the [[Mounted Rifles Hat|MRH|acronym_ner]] became the standard [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] ceremonial headdress with the "lemon squeezer" being retained only for colour parties and other limited categories.

NZDPM and NZDDPM were replaced in [[2013|DATE]] by a single camouflage pattern and a new uniform called the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] Multi Terrain Camouflage [[Army Combat Uniform|Uniform|alias_match_single_candidate]] (MCU.)

Due to shortcomings and poor performances of the [[MCU|ORGANIZATION]] uniform, the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] announced plans to replace it in [[2020|DATE]] with a new camouflage pattern called NZMTP, based on the British [[Multi-Terrain Pattern|Multi-Terrain Pattern|annotation]] ([[Multi-Terrain Pattern|MTP|alias_match_single_candidate]]) produced by [[Crye Precision|ORGANIZATION]] in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Army|alias_match_article_entity]] is commanded by the [[Chief of Army (New Zealand)|Chief of Army|annotation]] ([[Chief of Army (New Zealand)|Chief of the General Staff|alias_match_single_candidate]] until [[2002|DATE]]), who is a major general or two-star appointment.

For operations, the [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]]'s combat units fall under the command of the Land Component Commander, who is on the staff of the COMJFNZ at [[Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand|Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand|annotation]] at [[Trentham|LOCATION]] in [[Upper Hutt|LOCATION]].

There are [[Far East Strategic Reserve|Reserve|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] units throughout [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]], and they have a long history.

The modern [[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] Reserve is divided into [[three|NUMBER]] regionally-based battalion groups.

The [[six|NUMBER]] regiments command all [[Territorial Force|ORGANIZATION]] personnel within their region except those posted to formation or command headquarters, [[Military Police|Military Police|acronym_entity]] ([[Military Police|MP|acronym]]) Company, [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Force Intelligence Group|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] ([[Force Intelligence Group|FIG|acronym]]) or 1 [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Special Air Service|Special Air Services|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] ([[New Zealand Special Air Service|NZSAS|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) Regiment.

[[New Zealand Army|Army|alias_match_article_entity]] plans [[now|DATE]] envisage a [[three|NUMBER]] manoeuvre unit structure of [[1|NUMBER]] [[Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment|RNZIR|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], QAMR, and [[Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment|2/1 RNZIR|alias_match_single_candidate]] (light), being brought up to strength by TF individual and subunit reinforcements.

Vollaro clan

The [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro clan|annotation]] is a Neapolitan [[Camorra|Camorra|annotation]] clan operating in the area east of [[Naples|Naples|annotation]], more specifically in the town of [[Portici|LOCATION]] and [[San Sebastiano|LOCATION]] al Vesuvio, a small village in the [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius|annotation]] area.

The [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro clan|alias_match_article_entity]] was founded in the mid-seventies by [[Luigi Vollaro|Luigi Vollaro|annotation]] nicknamed ""'o Califfo"" (The Caliph) for [[Luigi Vollaro|his|PERSON_coref]] alleged unlimited sexual potency.

The [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro clan|alias_match_article_entity]] has fought [[two|NUMBER]] Cammora wars.

The [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro clan|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[first|ORDINAL]] clans to take sides with the powerful [[Alfieri clan|Alfieri clan|annotation]] from [[Nola|Piazzolla di Nola|annotation]], led by [[Carmine Alfieri|Carmine Alfieri|annotation]] against the [[Nuova Camorra Organizzata|Nuova Camorra Organizzata|annotation]] ([[Nuova Camorra Organizzata|NCO|alias_match_single_candidate]]) which was led by [[Raffaele Cutolo|Raffaele Cutolo|annotation]].

[[Vollaro clan|Vollaro|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was later sentenced to life imprisonment for this murder.

In [[2003|DATE]], [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] received [[a second|DURATION]] life sentence for the murder of Carlo Lardone.

In [[1992|DATE]], [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was subjected to the harsh [[Article 41-bis prison regime|Article 41-bis prison regime|annotation]], thus having the distinction of being [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Camorra|Camorra|alias_match_match_candidate]] bosses to be subjected to this regime.

The continuing arrests of the [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro clan|alias_match_article_entity]]'s members is likely to break the balance of local organized crime.

After the murder of [[Ciro D'Anna|PERSON]], affiliate of the clan, on [[December 23, 2019|DATE]], news emerged that the [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro clan|alias_match_article_entity]] would be at war with the [[Mazzarella clan|Mazzarella clan|annotation]], due to the interests of the latter in expanding their territories into the [[Vollaro clan|Vollaro|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s zone of influence.

The dictionary complemented [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|his|PERSON_coref]] [[1993|DATE]] 150-page "[[Maldives|Maldives|alias_match_match_candidate]] (World Bibliographical Series number [[158|NUMBER]])" book.

During [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|his|PERSON_coref]] career as a Sinhalese lecturer at the [[SOAS University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)|annotation]] in [[London|London|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|he|PERSON_coref]] taught and extensively researched the [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese language|annotation]] and its pre-1815 literature: the [[Sri Lankan|LOCATION]] government awarded [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|him|PERSON_coref]] the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka Ranajana medal|annotation]] for this.

[[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|Christopher Hanby Baillie Reynolds|alias_match_article_entity]] was born [[29 July 1922|DATE]] in [[St Albans|St Albans|annotation]], [[England|England|annotation]]; [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|his|PERSON_coref]] father was the registrar of the [[Clergy Support Trust|Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy|annotation]].

[[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|His|PERSON_coref]] Honour Mods studies including [[Modern language|Modern Languages|annotation]] at [[New College, Oxford|New College, Oxford|annotation]] were interrupted in [[1942|DATE]] by [[World War II|World War II|annotation]] war service in [[Italy|Italy|annotation]], taking [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|him|PERSON_coref]] after [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]] (but still in the army) to [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka|annotation]] (then [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) where [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|he|PERSON_coref]] was fascinated by the [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese language|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], script and culture.

After [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]], with a Forlong scholarship, [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|he|PERSON_coref]] gained a [[BA|ORGANIZATION]] degree in [[Sri Lanka|Sinhalese|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] at [[SOAS University of London|SOAS|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

After graduating at [[SOAS University of London|SOAS|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|he|PERSON_coref]] was promptly appointed to a [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] lectureship there.

When in the [[Maldives|Maldives|alias_match_match_candidate]], then hardly ever visited by foreigners, [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|he|PERSON_coref]] studied the [[Maldivian language|Maldivian language|alias_match_match_candidate]], which is related to [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese|alias_match_multiple_candidates]].

[[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|His|PERSON_coref]] "[[England|English|alias_match_single_candidate]]-[[Maldives|Maldivian|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] dictionary; Bilingual edition" was published by [[Routledge|Routledge|PERSON_popular_entity]] on [[17 April 2003|DATE]], .

Traffic (2000 film)

[[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios, but it was rejected because of the [[three-hour|DURATION]] running time and the subject matter—"[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" is more of a political film than most [[Hollywood productions|ORGANIZATION]].

"[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" earned numerous awards, including [[four|NUMBER]] [[Academy Awards|Oscars|annotation]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director|annotation]] for [[Steven Soderbergh|Steven Soderbergh|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor|annotation]] for [[Benicio del Toro|Benicio del Toro|annotation]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay|annotation]] for [[Stephen Gaghan|Stephen Gaghan|annotation]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing|annotation]] for [[Stephen Mirrione|Stephen Mirrione|annotation]].

In [[2004|DATE]], [[USA Network|USA Network|annotation]] ran a miniseries—also called "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]"—based on this film and the [[1989|DATE]] British television series.

"[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" was originally going to be distributed by [[20th Century Fox|ORGANIZATION]], but it was put into turnaround unless actor [[Harrison Ford|Harrison Ford|annotation]] agreed to star.

[[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] began shopping the film to other studios, but when [[Ford Motor Company|Ford|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] suddenly showed interest in "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]", Fox's interest in the film was renewed, and the studio took it out of turnaround.

[[Focus Features|USA Films|annotation]], however, had wanted to take on [[Traffic (2000 film)|the movie|non_person_coref]] from the [[first|ORDINAL]] time [[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] approached them.

[[Focus Features|USA Films|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] agreed to give [[Steven Soderbergh|him|PERSON_coref]] final cut on "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" and also agreed to [[Steven Soderbergh|his|PERSON_coref]] term that all the [[Mexico|Mexican|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] characters would speak [[Spanish language|Spanish|annotation]] while talking to each other.

[[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] said "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" had influences from [[Erin Brockovich (film)|the film|non_person_coref]]s of [[Richard Lester|Richard Lester|annotation]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard|annotation]].

Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]".

The director acted as [[Steven Soderbergh|his|PERSON_coref]] own cinematographer under the pseudonym [[Steven Soderbergh|Peter Andrews|alias_match_single_candidate]] and operated the camera himself in an effort to "get as close to [[Traffic (2000 film)|the movie|non_person_coref]] as I can," and to eliminate the distance between [[Harrison Ford|the actor|non_person_coref]]s and himself.

The [[first|ORDINAL]] cut of "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" ran [[three hours|DURATION]] and [[ten minutes|DURATION]].

"[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" was given a limited release on [[December 27, 2000|DATE]], in [[four|NUMBER]] theaters where it grossed on its opening [[weekend|DATE]].

The site's critical consensus reads, "[[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] successfully pulls off the highly ambitious "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]", a movie with [[three|NUMBER]] different stories and a very large cast.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert|annotation]] gave [[All the President's Men (film)|the film|non_person_coref]] [[four|NUMBER]] out of [[four|NUMBER]] stars and wrote, "[[Traffic (2000 film)|the movie|non_person_coref]] is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach.

It is so restrained that at [[one|NUMBER]] moment - the judge's final speech - I wanted [[one|NUMBER]] more sentence, making a point, but [[Traffic (2000 film)|the movie|non_person_coref]] lets us supply that thought for ourselves".

[[Stephen Holden|PERSON]], in [[Stephen Holden|his|PERSON_coref]] review for "[[The New York Times|The New York Times|annotation]]", wrote, ""[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller.

In [[Stephen Holden|his|PERSON_coref]] review for "[[The New York Observer|The New York Observer|annotation]]", [[Andrew Sarris|Andrew Sarris|annotation]] wrote, ""[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" marks [[[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]] definitively as an enormous talent, [[one|NUMBER]] who never lets us guess what [[Andrew Sarris|he|PERSON_coref]]'s going to do next.

However, [[Richard Schickel|Richard Schickel|annotation]] of "[[Time (magazine)|Time|annotation]]", in a rare negative review, finds [[All the President's Men (film)|the film|non_person_coref]]'s biggest weakness to be that it contains the "cliches of a [[hundred|NUMBER]] crime movies" before concluding that "[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]], for all its earnestness, does not work.

"[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]]" a

In [[Australia|Australia|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic|alias_match_article_entity]] was released on DVD by [[Village Roadshow|ORGANIZATION]], with an MA15+ rating.





Samoth

[[Samoth|Samoth|annotation]] (born [[Samoth|Tomas Thormodsæter Haugen|annotation]], [[9 June 1974|DATE]]) is a musician and multi-instrumentalist in the Norwegian black metal scene.

[[Samoth|He|PERSON_coref]] is well known for [[Samoth|his|PERSON_coref]] distinct guitar work and drumming in [[Emperor (band)|the band|non_person_coref]] [[Emperor (band)|Emperor|annotation]], as well as [[Samoth|his|PERSON_coref]] formation of the death metal band [[Zyklon|Zyklon|annotation]].

In very early [[Emperor (band)|Emperor|alias_match_single_candidate]] releases, [[Samoth|he|PERSON_coref]] was called [[Samoth|Samot|annotation]] ([[Samoth|his|PERSON_coref]] name "Tomas" backward), and with the formation of [[Zyklon|Zyklon|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Samoth|he|PERSON_coref]] became known as [[Samoth|Zamoth|annotation]].

[[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] was the owner of the record label [[Nocturnal Art Productions|ORGANIZATION]] and had a close relationship with [[Candlelight Records|Candlelight Records|annotation]].

[[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] was born on [[9 June 1974|DATE]] in [[Hammerfest|Hammerfest|annotation]], [[Norway|Norway|annotation]].

[[Samoth|He|PERSON_coref]] is the son of Spoonful of Blues bass player [[Jens Haugen|PERSON]], who encouraged [[Jens Haugen|his|PERSON_coref]] son to play bass guitar.

When [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] was a young man, [[Samoth|he|PERSON_coref]] met a fellow musician, who would later become known as [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|annotation]], at a rock cl

[[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|annotation]]'s friendship proved to be strong, and the [[two|NUMBER]] eventually took their musicianship to a new level.

Partially due to the influence of [[Euronymous|Euronymous|annotation]] of [[Mayhem (band)|the band|non_person_coref]] [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem|annotation]], [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] left [[Thou Shalt Suffer|Thou Shalt Suffer|alias_match_match_candidate]] and with [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|alias_match_match_candidate]], began writing music for a new band called [[Emperor (band)|Emperor|annotation]] (in which [[Ihsahn|he|PERSON_coref]] played drums).

[[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|alias_match_match_candidate]] was the only member of [[Thou Shalt Suffer|Thou Shalt Suffer|alias_match_match_candidate]] to remain, and soon bass player [[Mortiis|Mortiis|annotation]] and drummer [[Faust (musician)|Faust|annotation]] were recruited for [[Emperor (band)|Emperor|alias_match_single_candidate]]; [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] moved back to [[Samoth|his|PERSON_coref]] more familiar position of guitar.

[[Mortiis|Mortiis|alias_match_match_candidate]] did not stay in [[Emperor (band)|the band|non_person_coref]], and decided to form [[Samoth|his|PERSON_coref]] own, more electronic-based solo band.

[[Samoth|He|PERSON_coref]] was succeeded by [[Tchort|Tchort|annotation]].

In [[1994|DATE]] [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] was sentenced to [[16 months|DURATION]] in prison for burning [[Skjold Church|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Vindafjord|Vindafjord|annotation]], together with [[Varg Vikernes|Varg Vikernes|annotation]].

The arson was committed during a pause in the recording of the [[Burzum|Burzum|annotation]] EP "Aske" ("Ashes"), where [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] performed as a session bass player.

After [[years|DURATION]] of playing in [[Emperor (band)|Emperor|alias_match_single_candidate]] and being featured on various black metal side projects, [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]], in conjunction with [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|alias_match_match_candidate]], decided to dissolve [[Emperor (band)|Emperor|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[2001|DATE]] due to their differing musical tastes.

Although black metal was both [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s biggest influence and favorite genre of music, [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] was leaning toward a futuristic death metal sound, while [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|alias_match_match_candidate]] was more influenced by progressive metal and symphonic metal.

[[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] went on to play guitar with fellow drummer [[Trym|ORGANIZATION]] in the death metal band [[Zyklon|Zyklon|annotation]].

[[Emperor (band)|Emperor|alias_match_single_candidate]] regrouped in [[2006|DATE]] with the core trio of [[Ihsahn|Ihsahn|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Trym|ORGANIZATION]] augmented by a bassist and a keyboardist, and played a few one-night-off gigs in [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[United States|USA|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] in [[2006|DATE]] and [[2007|DATE]].

[[Recently|DATE]] [[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] was involved in [[Norway|Norwegian|alias_match_single_candidate]]-American supergroup [[Scum (band)|Scum|annotation]], which also featured [[Faust (musician)|Bård Faust|annotation]], Cosmocrator of Mindgrinder, Chasey Chaos of [[Amen (American band)|Amen|annotation]] and [[Happy Tom|ORGANIZATION]] from [[Turbonegro|Turbonegro|annotation]].

[[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] did voice work for [[2007|DATE]]'s [[Adult Swim|Adult Swim|annotation]] cartoon "[[Metalocalypse|Metalocalypse|annotation]]" episode "Dethfashion".

[[Samoth|Samoth|alias_match_article_entity]] has stated in an interview with "[[Metal Hammer|Metal Hammer|annotation]]" that the following kit was used by himself to record drum tracks for the demo ""[[Wrath of the Tyrant|Wrath Of The Tyrant|annotation]]"".





Syrian National Council

The [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|annotation]] ([[Syrian National Council|SNC|annotation]]; [[المجلس الوطني|NUMBER]] السوري, "al-[[Majlis|Majlis|annotation]] al-Waṭanī as-Sūri", Conseil national syrien), sometimes known as the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Transitional Council|annotation]] or the [[Syrian National Council|National Council of Syria|annotation]], is a [[Syrian opposition|Syrian opposition|annotation]] coalition, based in [[Istanbul|Istanbul|annotation]], [[Turkey|Turkey|annotation]], formed in [[August 2011|DATE]] during the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian civil uprising (which escalated into civil war)|annotation]] against the government of [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar al-Assad|annotation]].

The [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] seeks the end of [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar al-Assad|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s rule and the establishment of a modern, civil, democratic state.

The [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] National Charter lists human rights, judicial independence, press freedom, democracy and political pluralism as its guiding principles.

In [[November 2012|DATE]], the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] agreed to unify with several other opposition groups to form the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|annotation]], commonly named the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|Syrian National Coalition|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

The [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] withdrew from the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|Syrian National Coalition|annotation]] on [[20 January 2014|DATE]] in protest at the decision of the coalition to attend the [[Geneva II Conference on Syria|Geneva II Conference on Syria|annotation]].

The [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]]'s formation was announced in [[Istanbul|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Istanbul|Istanbul, Turkey|annotation]] on [[23 August 2011|DATE]], after a succession of meetings in [[Turkey|Turkey|alias_match_match_candidate]] and elsewhere.

The creation of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] was celebrated by the [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] protestors since the [[Friday|DATE]] protest following its establishment was dubbed "The [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] Represents Me".

[[Yaser Tabbara|PERSON]], the council's spokesman at that time, said the membership of the council would include [[115|NUMBER]] to [[120|NUMBER]] members from all [[Syrian opposition|Syrian opposition|alias_match_match_candidate]] groups, including the [[now|DATE]] defunct [[Syrian National Council|National Council of Syria|alias_match_article_entity]].

In [[November 2012|DATE]], the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] agreed to unify with several other opposition groups to form the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|annotation]], commonly named the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|Syrian National Coalition|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], with the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] having [[22|NUMBER]] out of [[60|NUMBER]] seats.

On [[20 January 2014|DATE]], the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] announced that it was leaving the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|Syrian National Coalition|annotation]] in protest at the decision of the coalition to attend the [[Geneva II Conference on Syria|Geneva II Conference on Syria|annotation]].

The [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] stated that participating in the talks would go backwards on its stance "to not enter negotiations" until president al-[[Bashar al-Assad|Assad|alias_match_single_candidate]] left office.

The [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]]'s membership includes many members of the exiled [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] wing of the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood|annotation]] and is supported by the [[Damascus Declaration|Damascus Declaration|annotation]]'s exile wing.

The [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] itself claims to represent approximately [[60 percent|PERCENT]] of the [[Syrian opposition|Syrian opposition|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The only Kurdish party from inside [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]] to have declared itself an affiliate of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] is the [[Kurdish Future Movement in Syria|Kurdish Future Movement|annotation]] under the leadership of [[Mashaal Tammo|Mashaal Tammo|annotation]], who was assassinated shortly after the announcement in the northeastern city of [[Qamishli|Qamishli|annotation]].

Former [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood|alias_match_match_candidate]] leader [[Ali Sadr el-Din Bayanouni|PERSON]] stated that [[Burhan Ghalioun|Ghalioun|alias_match_single_candidate]] was chosen because [[Burhan Ghalioun|he|PERSON_coref]] "is accepted in the West and at home and, to prevent the regime from capitalising on the presence of an Islamist at the top of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]]."

Plagued with internal conflict, the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] on [[13 March 2012|DATE]] saw [[three|NUMBER]] prominent members resigning, giving as their reason that the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] "had not gotten very far in working to arm the rebels,".

Their reasons for resigning were that the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] is corrupt, a liberal front for the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood|annotation]] and had not made significant progress in arming the rebels.

[[One|NUMBER]] secular member of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] claimed that more than half of the council are [[Islamism|Islamists|annotation]].

On [[27 March 2012|DATE]], the [[recently|DATE]] resigned members, including [[Maleh|PERSON]] and Labwani, agreed to rejoin the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]], under the condition that [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] would agree to be more democratic and expand, although [[Labwani|PERSON]] expressed doubts whether the opposition would be able to hold together, but said that for [[now|DATE]] their accord will help Arab and Western governments make [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad|alias_match_single_candidate]] stop [[Bashar al-Assad|his|PERSON_coref]] brutal repression.

Abdual al-Haj of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] said that "[[now|DATE]] the international community no longer has an excuse to withhold support for the revolution, help arm the Free [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Army and establish safe zones to protect the civilian [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] population."

Despite the [[National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change|National Coordination Committee|annotation]] not attending and the Kurdish delegation as well as an unnamed senior dissident walking out, the [[BBC|BBC|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] reported from the meeting that "[a]ll but [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s disparate opposition groups have agreed to unite behind the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]]."

The [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]], despite having had a Kurdish chairman, does not have [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish nationalist|annotation]] members.

Abdulhakim [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria|Secretary-General of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Syria|annotation]], claims the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] is too "much influenced by [[Turkey|Turkey|alias_match_match_candidate]]" and demanded guarantees for the Kurds in [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]] by the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] and says that [[Turkey|Turkey|alias_match_match_candidate]] would, in turn, be obliged to grant full rights to [[Turkey|Turkey|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s Kurds.

On [[28 October 2011|DATE]], the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] expressed worries about the Libyan scenario (with the violent overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi|Muammar Gaddafi|annotation]]) being reiterated in [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]].

However, the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] came to review its position on the peaceful nature of the uprising.

According to the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]], the opposition is [[now|DATE]] faced with [[two|NUMBER]] options: "greater militarization of local resistance or foreign intervention."

As a result, in the context of increasing defections in the military and the escalating violence in [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]], the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] and the Free [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Army struck a deal in [[January 2012|DATE]], recognising the units of anti-government rebels fighting in [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]].

The [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] said that it was the duty of the opposition "to assist the rebels."

While the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] asserted that it would not provide arms directly to the Free [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Army, it will provide funds to "keep the Free [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Army afloat."

For this reason, donations can be made on the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] website.

[[Marc Lynch|PERSON]], a Professor of [[Political Science|ORGANIZATION]] in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]], is cited from [[Marc Lynch|his|PERSON_coref]] [[April 2016|DATE]] book "The New Arab Wars: Uprising and Anarchy in the [[Middle East|Middle East|LOCATION_popular_entity]]" as describing the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] as a conduit by which the hopelessly factionalised [[Syrian opposition|Syrian opposition|alias_match_match_candidate]] attracted and distributed money and arms from foreign sponsors.

Prior to joining the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|annotation]], the [[Syrian National Council|Syrian National Council|alias_match_article_entity]] had been recognised as the legitimate representative of the [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] people by several UN member states.

On [[27 February 2012|DATE]], [[Haitham al-Maleh|Haitham al-Maleh|annotation]] and [[Kamal al-Labwani|Kamal al-Labwani|annotation]] along with [[18|NUMBER]] other members of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] formed a sub-group called the [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Patriotic Group.

The leading activists of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] consider many of the [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] members to be too slow in taking action, and so [[Muslim Brotherhood|the group|non_person_coref]] is designed so that while still remaining [[Syrian National Council|SNC|alias_match_article_entity]] members, the [[20|NUMBER]] leading activists would speed up "backing the national effort to bring down the regime with all available resistance means including supporting the Free [[Syrians|Syrian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Army".

Millennium Line

The [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|annotation]] is the [[second|ORDINAL]] line of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain|annotation]] rapid transit system in the [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver|annotation]] region of [[British Columbia|British Columbia|annotation]], [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] operates from [[VCC|ORGANIZATION]]–[[Clark|PERSON]] station in [[Vancouver|Vancouver|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[Lafarge|ORGANIZATION]] Lake–[[Douglas|PERSON]] station in [[Coquitlam|Coquitlam|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Millennium Line|the line|non_person_coref]] is elevated to [[Burquitlam station|Burquitlam station|annotation]], where it then goes through a [[2|NUMBER]] km bored tunnel to [[Coquitlam|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Port Moody|Port Moody|annotation]].

In [[Port Moody|Port Moody|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Millennium Line|the line|non_person_coref]] runs at grade level, rising to cross railway tracks.

From [[Coquitlam Central station|Coquitlam Central station|annotation]], [[Millennium Line|the line|non_person_coref]] is elevated to the terminus at [[Lafarge|ORGANIZATION]] Lake–[[Douglas|PERSON]] station.

Westbound [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] trains crossed over to left-hand running just south of [[Burquitlam station|Burquitlam station|alias_match_match_candidate]], which allowed them to access westbound Platform [[2|NUMBER]] at [[Lougheed Town Centre|ORGANIZATION]] station.

This unusual service design allowed same-platform interchange for [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|annotation]] passengers arriving at [[Lougheed Town Centre|ORGANIZATION]] and continuing west towards [[VCC–Clark station|VCC–Clark station|annotation]] on the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]].

This change meant passengers arriving westbound at [[Lougheed|LOCATION]] on the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] who wished to continue towards [[VCC–Clark station|VCC–Clark|alias_match_single_candidate]] could either change platforms at [[Lougheed|LOCATION]] or remain on their [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] train until its terminus at the next station, [[Production Way–University station|Production Way–University|annotation]], where they could make a same-platform transfer to a westbound [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] train.

For passengers arriving eastbound at [[Lougheed|LOCATION]], transfers between eastbound [[Millennium Line|Millennium|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] trains were [[now|DATE]] same-platform.

Neither plan was realized, although the extension of [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] tracks to [[Columbia station (SkyTrain)|Columbia Station|annotation]] in [[1989|DATE]] and the completion of the [[Skybridge (TransLink)|SkyBridge|annotation]] to [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey|annotation]] in [[1990|DATE]] resulted in a short spur east of [[Columbia station (SkyTrain)|Columbia station|alias_match_single_candidate]], which was later incorporated into the new [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]].

This meant that the [[first|ORDINAL]] phase of [[Millennium Line|the line|non_person_coref]] would have to connect to the existing [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] to use its maintenance yard.

Connecting the [[two|NUMBER]] lines at [[Commercial–Broadway station|Broadway station|annotation]] was deemed impracticable, so [[Millennium Line|the line|non_person_coref]]s were connected in [[New Westminster|New Westminster|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Switches to the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] were installed on the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] at the north end of the [[Skybridge (TransLink)|Skybridge|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] opened for revenue service on [[January 7, 2002|DATE]] (a preview for [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain|alias_match_single_candidate]] passengers took place on the prior [[two days|DURATION]]), with trains operating between [[Waterfront station (Vancouver)|Waterfront station|annotation]] on the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Braid station|Braid station|annotation]] in eastern [[New Westminster|New Westminster|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[now|DATE]] completed at a cost of [[$1.2billion|MONEY]], [[$40million|MONEY]] under budget.

In [[2007|DATE]], the non-interlined portion of the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] served an average of [[70,000|NUMBER]] passengers per [[day|DURATION]].

Initially, the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] service followed the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line|alias_match_single_candidate]] from [[Waterfront station (Vancouver)|Waterfront|alias_match_single_candidate]] to [[British Columbia|Columbia|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] stations, then looped back into [[Vancouver|Vancouver|alias_match_match_candidate]] via the new route, passing through [[Commercial–Broadway station|Commercial–Broadway|annotation]] again, at a different platform, and terminating at [[VCC–Clark station|VCC–Clark station|alias_match_match_candidate]].

After a reconfiguration on [[October 22, 2016|DATE]], in preparation for the opening of the [[Evergreen Extension|Evergreen Extension|annotation]], the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] ran between [[VCC–Clark station|VCC–Clark station|alias_match_match_candidate]] in the west to [[Lougheed Town Centre station|Lougheed Town Centre station|alias_match_match_candidate]] in the east.

The [[second|ORDINAL]] phase of the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] was to be an extension from [[The City of Lougheed|Lougheed Mall|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to [[Coquitlam|Coquitlam|alias_match_match_candidate]] (then known as the [[Port Moody|Port Moody|alias_match_match_candidate]]–[[Coquitlam|Coquitlam|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Coquitlam|PMC|acronym]]) Line), which would have provided a "one-seat ride" from [[Coquitlam|Coquitlam|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[VCC–Clark station|VCC–Clark station|alias_match_match_candidate]].

A [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain|alias_match_single_candidate]] extension from [[Lougheed Town Centre station|Lougheed Town Centre station|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[Coquitlam|Coquitlam|alias_match_match_candidate]] Town Centre was proposed when the original [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] was built and the necessary junction tracks for such an extension were built at [[Lougheed Town Centre station|the station|non_person_coref]] during its initial construction.

On [[March 16, 2018|DATE]], the provincial government approved the construction of the "Broadway Subway Project", an initiative which will extend the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] west to Arbutus Street and add [[six|NUMBER]] new stations.

The existing [[Broadway–City Hall station|Broadway–City Hall station|alias_match_match_candidate]] on the [[Canada Line|Canada Line|alias_match_match_candidate]], originally designed with a "knock-out" panel to accommodate a connection to a [[future|DATE]] [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] extension, will be upgraded and connected to the extension.

An adjacent development was required by the [[Vancouver|City of Vancouver|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to provide space for an additional entrance to the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] portion of [[Lougheed Town Centre station|the station|non_person_coref]].

On [[January 14, 2008|DATE]], the [[British Columbia|Government of British Columbia|alias_match_single_candidate]] announced a commitment to the expansion of the [[Millennium Line|Millennium Line|alias_match_article_entity]] to the [[University of British Columbia|University of British Columbia|annotation]] ([[University of British Columbia|UBC|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) by [[2020|DATE]] as part of a [[$14-billion|MONEY]] transit spending package to address global warming.

Despite having spent [[18 years|DURATION]] away from the sport, [[Debbie Evans|she|PERSON_coref]] finished the season in a respectable [[8th|ORDINAL]] place.

[[Debbie Evans|Evans|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was inducted to the [[AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame|ORGANIZATION]] in [[2003|DATE]].




National Science Foundation Network

The [[National Science Foundation Network|National Science Foundation Network|annotation]] ([[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|annotation]]) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation|annotation]] ([[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]) from [[1985|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1995|DATE]] to promote advanced research and education networking in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Initially created to link researchers to the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the [[Internet backbone|Internet backbone|annotation]].

[[National Science Foundation|The National Science Foundation|alias_match_single_candidate]] permitted only government agencies and universities to use [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]] until [[1989|DATE]] when the [[first|ORDINAL]] commercial [[Internet service provider|Internet service provider|annotation]] emerged.

By [[1991|DATE]], the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] removed restrictions on access and the commercial [[Internet service provider|ISP|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] business grew rapidly.

Following the deployment of the [[CSNET|Computer Science Network|annotation]] ([[CSNET|CSNET|alias_match_match_candidate]]), a network that provided [[Internet service provider|Internet services|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to academic computer science departments, in [[1981|DATE]], the U.S. [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation|annotation]] ([[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]) aimed to create an academic research network facilitating access by researchers to the supercomputing centers funded by [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[1985|DATE]], [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] began funding the creation of [[five|NUMBER]] new supercomputing centers:

Also in [[1985|DATE]], under the leadership of [[Dennis Jennings (Internet pioneer)|Dennis Jennings|annotation]], the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] established the [[National Science Foundation Network|National Science Foundation Network|alias_match_article_entity]] ([[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]]).

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] was to be a general-purpose research network, a hub to connect the [[five|NUMBER]] supercomputing centers along with the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]-funded [[National Center for Atmospheric Research|National Center for Atmospheric Research|annotation]] ([[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) to each other and to the regional research and education networks that would in turn connect campus networks.

Using this [[three|NUMBER]] tier network architecture [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] would provide access between the supercomputer centers and other sites over the backbone network at no cost to the centers or to the regional networks using the open [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP|annotation]] protocols initially deployed successfully on the [[ARPANET|ARPANET|annotation]].

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] initiated operations in [[1986|DATE]] using [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP|annotation]].

PDP-11/[[73|NUMBER]] minicomputers with routing and management software, called Fuzzballs, served as [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]] routers since they already implemented the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] standard.

Support for [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] end-users was provided by the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] Network Service Center ([[NNSC|ORGANIZATION]]), located at [[BBN Technologies|BBN Technologies|annotation]] and included publishing the softbound "[[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] Manager's Phonebook" which listed the contact information for every issued domain name and [[Internet protocol suite|IP|alias_match_single_candidate]] address in [[1990|DATE]].

Incidentally, [[Ed Krol|Ed Krol|alias_match_match_candidate]] also authored the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]]" to help users of the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] understand its capabilities.

As regional networks grew the 56kbit/s [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone experienced rapid increases in network traffic and became seriously congested.

In [[June 1987|DATE]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] issued a new solicitation to upgrade and expand [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]].

As a result of a [[November 1987|DATE]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] award to the [[Merit Network|Merit Network|annotation]], a networking consortium by public universities in [[Michigan|Michigan|annotation]], the original 56kbit/s network was expanded to include [[13|NUMBER]] nodes interconnected at [[1.5|NUMBER]]Mbit/s ([[Digital Signal 1|T-1|annotation]]) by [[July 1988|DATE]].

Under its cooperative agreement with [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] the [[Merit Network|Merit Network|annotation]] was the lead organization in a partnership that included [[IBM|IBM|annotation]], [[MCI Inc.|MCI|annotation]], and the [[Michigan|State of Michigan|annotation]].

[[Eric M. Aupperle|PERSON]], [[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s President, was the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Project Director, and [[Hans-Werner Braun|PERSON]] was Co-Principal Investigator.

During this period, but separate from its support for the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] funded:

* the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] Connections Program that helped colleges and universities obtain or upgrade connections to regional networks;

* the [[International Connections Manager|International Connections Manager|acronym_entity]] ([[International Connections Manager|ICM|acronym]]), a task performed by [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint|annotation]], that encouraged connections between the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone and international research and education networks; and

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] became the principal [[Internet backbone|Internet backbone|alias_match_match_candidate]] starting in [[the Summer of 1986|DATE]], when [[MIDnet|MIDnet|annotation]], the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] regional backbone network became operational.

By [[1988|DATE]], in addition to the [[five|NUMBER]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] supercomputer centers, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] included connectivity to [[Michigan|the region|non_person_coref]]al networks BARRNet, JVNCNet, [[Merit Network|Merit/MichNet|annotation]], [[MIDnet|MIDnet|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], NorthWestNet, NYSERNet, SESQUINET, SURAnet, and Westnet, which in turn connected about [[170|NUMBER]] additional networks to the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] connected to other federal government networks including the [[NASA|NASA|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] Science [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]], the [[Energy Science Network|ORGANIZATION]] ([[Energy Sciences Network|ESnet|annotation]]), and others.

The existence of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] and the FIXes allowed the [[ARPANET|ARPANET|annotation]] to be phased out in mid-1990.

Starting in [[August 1990|DATE]] the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone supported the [[Connectionless-mode Network Service|OSI Connectionless Network Protocol|annotation]] ([[Connectionless-mode Network Service|CLNP|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) in addition to [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

Traffic on [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]] continued its rapid growth, doubling [[every seven months|SET]].

[[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] allowed routers on the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone to differentiate routes originally learned via multiple paths.

In anticipation of the T-3 upgrade and the approaching end of the [[5-year|DURATION]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] cooperative agreement, in [[September 1990|DATE]] [[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[IBM|IBM|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[MCI Inc.|MCI|alias_match_single_candidate]] formed [[Advanced Network and Services|Advanced Network and Services|annotation]] ([[Advanced Network and Services|ANS|acronym]]), a new non-profit corporation with a more broadly based [[Board of Directors|ORGANIZATION]] than the [[Michigan|Michigan|alias_match_match_candidate]]-based [[Merit Network|Merit Network|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Under its cooperative agreement with [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]] remained ultimately responsible for the operation of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]], but subcontracted much of the engineering and operations work to [[Advanced Network and Services|ANS|acronym_ner]].

The new T-3 backbone was named ANSNet and provided the physical infrastructure used by [[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]] to deliver the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service.

In addition to the [[five|NUMBER]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] supercomputer centers, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] provided connectivity to [[eleven|NUMBER]] regional networks and through these networks to many smaller regional and campus networks.

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] regional networks were:

*[[MIDnet|MIDnet|annotation]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln, Nebraska|annotation]] the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] regional backbone to become operational in [[the Summer of 1986|DATE]], serving [[Arkansas|Arkansas|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Iowa|Iowa|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Kansas|Kansas|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Missouri|Missouri|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Nebraska|Nebraska|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Oklahoma|Oklahoma|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and [[South Dakota|South Dakota|LOCATION_popular_entity]], later acquired by Global [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]], which was acquired by [[Verio, Inc.|ORGANIZATION]];

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]'s appropriations act authorized [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] to "foster and support the development and use of computer and other scientific and engineering methods and technologies, primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering."

This allowed [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] to support [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] and related networking initiatives, but only to the extent that that support was ""primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering"."

And this in turn was taken to mean that use of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] for commercial purposes was "not" allowed.

To ensure that [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] support was used appropriately, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] developed an "[[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Acceptable Use Policy|Acceptable Use Policy|acronym_entity]]" ([[Acceptable Use Policy|AUP|acronym]]) that outlined in broad terms the uses of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] that were and were not allowed.

The [[Acceptable Use Policy|AUP|acronym_ner]] was revised several times to make it clearer and to allow the broadest possible use of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]], consistent with [[Congress|ORGANIZATION]]' wishes as expressed in the appropriations act.

A notable feature of the [[Acceptable Use Policy|AUP|acronym_ner]] is that it talks about acceptable uses of [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]] that are not directly related to who or what type of organization is making that use.

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] did not monitor the content of traffic that was sent over [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] or actively police the use of [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]].

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]], and [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]]al networks did investigate possible cases of inappropriate use, when such use was brought to their attention.

The prohibition on commercial use of the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone meant that some organizations could not connect to the [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] via regional networks that were connected to the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone, while to be fully connected other organizations (or regional networks on their behalf), including some non-profit research and educational institutions, would need to obtain [[two|NUMBER]] connections, [[one|NUMBER]] to an [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] attached regional network and [[one|NUMBER]] to a non-[[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] attached network provider.

In [[1988|DATE]], [[Vint Cerf|Vint Cerf|annotation]], then at the [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives|Corporation for National Research Initiatives|acronym_entity]] ([[Corporation for National Research Initiatives|CNRI|acronym]]), proposed to the Federal Networking Council ([[CNRI|FNC|acronym]]) and to [[MCI Inc.|MCI|alias_match_single_candidate]] to interconnect the commercial [[MCI Mail|MCI Mail|annotation]] system to [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]].

In effect, the [[Federal Networking Council|FNC|acronym_ner]] permitted experimental use of the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone to carry commercial email traffic into and out of the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]].

The interesting side effect of these links to [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] was that the users of the heretofore disconnected commercial email services were able to exchange email with [[one|NUMBER]] another via the [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]].

During the period when [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] was being established, [[Internet service provider|Internet service providers|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] that allowed commercial traffic began to emerge, such as Alternet, [[PSINet|PSINet|annotation]], [[CERFNet|ORGANIZATION]], and others.

The commercial networks in many cases were interconnected to the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] and routed traffic over the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] nominally accordingly to the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] acceptable use policy Additionally, these early commercial networks often directly interconnected with each other as well as, on a limited basis, with some of [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]]al [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] networks.

[[Advanced Network and Services|ANS CO+RE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was the for-profit subsidiary of the non-profit [[Advanced Network and Services|Advanced Network and Services|annotation]] ([[Advanced Network and Services|ANS|acronym]]) that had been created earlier by the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] partners, [[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[IBM|IBM|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[MCI Inc.|MCI|alias_match_single_candidate]].

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service and [[Advanced Network and Services|ANS CO+RE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] both used and shared the common ANSNet infrastructure.

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] agreed to allow [[Advanced Network and Services|ANS CO+RE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to carry commercial traffic subject to several conditions:

* that the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service was not diminished;

* that [[Advanced Network and Services|ANS CO+RE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] recovered at least the average cost of the commercial traffic traversing [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]]; and

* that any excess revenues recovered above the cost of carrying the commercial traffic would be placed into an infrastructure pool to be distributed by an allocation committee broadly representative of [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]]ing community to enhance and extend national and regional networking infrastructure and support.

Meanwhile, [[Congress|ORGANIZATION]] passed its Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of [[1992|DATE]] that formally permitted [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] to connect to commercial networks in support of research and education.

For a time this state of affairs kept [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]]ing community as a whole from fully implementing the vision for the [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a worldwide network of fully interconnected [[Internet protocol suite|TCP|alias_match_single_candidate]]/[[Internet protocol suite|IP networks|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] allowing any connected site to communicate with any other connected site.

These issues would not be fully resolved until a new network architecture was developed and the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service was turned off in [[1995|DATE]].

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service was primarily used by academic and educational entities, and was a transitional network bridging

On [[April 30, 1995|DATE]], the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service had been successfully transitioned to a new architecture and the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone was decommissioned.

At this point the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] regional backbone networks were still central to the infrastructure of the expanding [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]], and there were still other [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] programs, but there was no longer a central [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone or network service.

After the transition, network traffic was carried on the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] regional backbone networks and any of several commercial backbone networks, internetMCI, [[PSINet|PSINet|annotation]], SprintLink, ANSNet, and others.

Competitively established, and initially funded by [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]], the NAPs were located in [[New York|LOCATION]] (actually [[New Jersey|New Jersey|LOCATION_popular_entity]]), [[Seattle|Washington|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[D.C.|LOCATION]], [[Chicago|Chicago|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[San Jose|LOCATION]] and run by [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint|annotation]], [[MFS Datanet|ORGANIZATION]], [[Ameritech|Ameritech|annotation]], and [[Pacific Bell|Pacific Bell|annotation]].

The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] regional backbone networks could connect to any of their newer peer commercial backbone networks or directly to the NAPs, but in either case they would need to pay for their own connection infrastructure.

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] provided some funding for the NAPs and interim funding to help [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]]al networks make the transition, but did not fund the new commercial backbone networks directly.

To help ensure the stability of the [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] during and immediately after the transition from [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]], [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] conducted a solicitation to select a [[Routing Arbiter|Routing Arbiter|acronym_entity]] ([[Routing Arbiter|RA|acronym]]) and ultimately made a joint award to the [[Merit Network|Merit Network|annotation]] and [[Information Sciences Institute|USC's Information Science Institute|annotation]] to act as the RA.

To continue its promotion of advanced networking technology the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] conducted a solicitation to create a very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) which, like [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] before it, would focus on providing service to the research and education community.

[[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] support was available to organizations that could demonstrate a need for very high speed networking capabilities and wished to connect to the vBNS or to the [[Abilene Network|Abilene Network|annotation]], the high speed network operated by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University|alias_match_single_candidate]] Corporation for Advanced [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] Development ([[Internet2|UCAID|annotation]], aka [[Internet2|Internet2|annotation]]).

For much of the period from [[1987|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1995|DATE]], following the opening up of the [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] through [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] and in particular after the creation of the for-profit [[Advanced Network and Services|ANS CO+RE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[May 1991|DATE]], some [[Internet|Internet|alias_match_match_candidate]] stakeholders were concerned over the effects of privatization and the manner in which ANS, [[IBM|IBM|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[MCI Inc.|MCI|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] received a perceived competitive advantage in leveraging federal research money to gain ground in fields in which other companies allegedly were more competitive.

On [[March 12, 1992|DATE]] the [[Subcommittee on Science of the Committee on Science|ORGANIZATION]], Space, and Technology, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives|annotation]], held a hearing to review the management of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]].

Witnesses at the hearing were asked to focus on the agreement(s) that [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] put in place for the operation of the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] backbone, the foundation's plan for recompetition of those agreements, and to help the subcommittee explore whether the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]'s policies provided a level playing field for network service providers, ensured that [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]] was responsive to user needs, and provided for effective network management.

At the end of the hearing, speaking to the [[two|NUMBER]] witnesses from [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Nico Habermann|Dr. Nico Habermann|annotation]], Assistant [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] Director for the [[Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate|ORGANIZATION]] ([[CISE|ORGANIZATION]]), and [[Stephen Wolff|Dr. Stephen Wolff|annotation]], Director of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[Division of Networking & Communications Research & Infrastructure|Division of Networking & Communications Research & Infrastructure|acronym_entity]] ([[Division of Networking & Communications Research & Infrastructure|DNCRI|acronym]]), [[Rick Boucher|Representative Boucher|annotation]], Chairman of the subcommittee, said:

Even those who have some constructive criticism of the way that [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]] is presently managed acknowledge at the outset that you have done a terrific job in accomplishing the goal of this [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]], and its user-ship is enormously up, its cost to the users has come down, and you certainly have our congratulations for that excellent success.

… to foster and support access by the research and education communities to computer networks which may be used substantially for purposes in addition to research and education in the sciences and engineering, if the additional uses will tend to increase the overall capabilities of [[National Science Foundation Network|the network|non_person_coref]]s to support such research and education activities (that is to say, commercial traffic).

This legislation allowed, but did not require, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] to repeal or modify its existing [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Acceptable Use Policy|Acceptable Use Policy|acronym_entity]] ([[Acceptable Use Policy|AUP|acronym]]) which restricted network use to activities in support of research and education.

SF|alias_match_article_entity]] Inspector General to conduct a review of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]]'s administration of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]]

. The [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]] Office of the Inspector General released its report on [[March 23, 1993|DATE]]. The report concluded by:

* stating that "[i]n general we were favorably impressed with the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] program and staff";

* finding no serious problems with the administration, management, and use of the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] Backbone Service;

* complimenting the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] partners, saying that "the exchange of views among [[National Science Foundation Network|NSF|alias_match_article_entity]], the [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] provider ([[Merit Network|Merit|alias_match_single_candidate]]/ANS), and the users of [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET|alias_match_article_entity]] [via a bulletin board system], is truly remarkable in a program of the federal government"; and





Ōnobori Mitsuhiro

[[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|annotation]] (born [[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|Isamu Ishida,|annotation]] [[August 1, 1925|DATE]] – [[March 1, 2009|DATE]]) was a sumo wrestler and coach from [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa, Nagano|annotation]], [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|He|PERSON_coref]] made [[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|his|PERSON_coref]] professional debut in [[January 1941|DATE]], reaching a highest rank of "maegashira" [[1|NUMBER]].

[[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|He|PERSON_coref]] retired in [[1957|DATE]].

From [[1971|DATE]] to [[1990|DATE]] [[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|he|PERSON_coref]] was the head coach of [[Kasugayama stable|Kasugayama stable|annotation]].

[[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|He|PERSON_coref]] joined [[Kasugayama stable|Kasugayama stable|annotation]] in [[1941|DATE]], recruited by the [[14th|ORDINAL]] [[Kasugayama stable|Kasugayama|alias_match_single_candidate]] Oyakata, ex-"sekiwake" Fujinokawa.

However [[Kasugayama stable|the stable|non_person_coref]] shut down in [[1947|DATE]] and [[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|he|PERSON_coref]] was transferred to [[Tatsunami stable|Tatsunami stable|annotation]].

[[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|Onobori|alias_match_article_entity]] remained in sumo as an elder of the [[Japan Sumo Association|Japan Sumo Association|annotation]], working as a coach at [[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|his|PERSON_coref]] old stable under a variety of elder names.

In [[January 1971|DATE]] [[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|he|PERSON_coref]] became head coach of [[Kasugayama stable|Kasugayama stable|alias_match_match_candidate]] following the death of ex-[[Nayoroiwa Shizuo|Nayoroiwa|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[Ōnobori Mitsuhiro|Onobori|alias_match_article_entity]] was a director of the [[Japan Sumo Association|Sumo Association|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] for [[four years from 1982|DATE]], and an auditor from [[1986|DATE]].

Le Vieux-Longueuil

[[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Le Vieux-Longueuil|annotation]] is a borough in [[Longueuil|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Longueuil|Longueuil|annotation]].

From [[2002|DATE]] to [[2006|DATE]], [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Le Vieux-Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] borough stood for what used to be [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] [[from|DATE]] [[1969|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[2002|DATE]].

The former city of [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] was composed of [[3|NUMBER]] cities merged in [[the 1960s|DATE]]: [[Ville Jacques-Cartier|Ville Jacques-Cartier|annotation]], [[Montréal-Sud|Montréal-Sud|annotation]] and [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]].

Since [[2006|DATE]], [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Le Vieux-Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] borough stands for the combination of the former city of [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Le Moyne, Quebec|LeMoyne|annotation]].

[[Le Moyne, Quebec|LeMoyne|alias_match_single_candidate]] joined [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Le Vieux-Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] borough when [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert|annotation]] left [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[2006|DATE]].

[[Canada Post|Canada Post|annotation]] uses "[[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]]" only on addresses that are located within the former city of [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]].

As such, many people continue to associate the name [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] to the former city rather than the [[current|DATE]] city.

The former city of [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]] has a neighbourhood which is also called [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|Vieux-Longueuil|alias_match_article_entity]].

Music of Saint Lucia

There is little [[Western Europe|Western|alias_match_single_candidate]] classical music on [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]], and the country's popular music industry is only nascent.

There is also a well-known government assisted non-profit music school, the [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] School of Music.

The musicians may also use a "lakonmèt" (mazurka), schottische or polka; the "lakonmèt", also called the "mazouk", is especially popular and is the only closed couple dance which originated in [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Societies of Saint Lucia|La Rose and La Marguerite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] are rival societies that commemorate the Anglo-French heritage of [[Saint Lucia|the island|non_person_coref]]; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] changed [[fourteen|NUMBER]] times.

In addition to "jwé" and other music performed for entertainment, [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] is also home to styles used only for specific occasions.

The latter [[two|NUMBER]] traditions are nearly extinct in modern [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]].

On [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]], wakes are held on the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[and eighth|ORDINAL]] [[night|TIME]] after a person has died, in contrast to other [[Caribbean|Caribbean islands|alias_match_single_candidate]], which hold their wakes on the [[first|ORDINAL]] [[and ninth days|DATE]].

The villages of [[La Grace|La Grace|annotation]], Piaye and [[Laborie|Laborie|annotation]] in the southwest area of [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] were known for a unique song-dance called the "koutoumba".

Only [[one|NUMBER]] family, from [[Ercolano|Resina|annotation]], in modern [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] claims to have the religious authority to perform and pass on the "kélé" rituals.

The [[Music of Saint Lucia|Lucian music|alias_match_article_entity]] industry is quite small scale, due to [[Saint Lucia|the island|non_person_coref]]'s small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures.

[[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] is home to several radio stations including Radio [[Saint Lucia|St. Lucia|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and Radio [[Caribbean|Caribbean|alias_match_match_candidate]] International, which play a variety of popular music; since [[1989|DATE]], [[Saint Lucia|St Lucian|alias_match_single_candidate]] radio stations have played an increasing number of programs about [[Saint Lucia|Lucian|alias_match_single_candidate]] culture and in the local Creole tongue.

Modern [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] has produced a few popular musicians in various styles, but is most closely associated with calypso music.

Auguste later introduced folk music into Saint [[Music of Saint Lucia|Lucian music|alias_match_article_entity]] education.

In the time leading up to independence from the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[1979|DATE]], [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] underwent a profound political and cultural awakening and roots revival which drew on the rise of the black consciousness movement of the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the influence of the [[Caribbean|Caribbean|alias_match_match_candidate]] Ecumenical Consultation for Development on local culture and the loosening of restrictions from the powerful [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] on non-Christian cultural elements.

This style of bouyon is mostly, but not exclusively, produced in [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]].

The government of [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] has worked with the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States|OECS|annotation]] to promote [[Caribbean|the region|non_person_coref]]al music industry through intellectual property law and sponsoring festivals and other activities.

Music is a part of the curriculum at public schools in [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]]; it has long been taught in younger grade levels, but was only introduced to secondary education in [[1999|DATE]].

Primary education on [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]], music and other artistic education is commonly used incidentally to teaching other subjects or for special occasions.

The public education field has also collaborated with the [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] School of Music to form the [[National Youth Choir|ORGANIZATION]], String Orchestra and [[Secondary Schools Wind Ensemble|ORGANIZATION]].

The [[Music of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia|alias_match_article_entity]] School of Music is an independent institute of music education that has [[two|NUMBER]] branches on [[Saint Lucia|the island|non_person_coref]], [[one|NUMBER]] in the north and [[one|NUMBER]] in the south.

Zara Yaqob

[[Zara Yaqob|Zar'a Ya`qob|annotation]] or [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|annotation]] ([[Geʽez|Ge'ez|annotation]]: [[ዘርአ ፡ ያዕቆብ|NUMBER]] "zar'ā yāʿiqōb", "Descendant of Jacob"; [[1399|DATE]] - [[26 August 1468|DATE]]) was the Emperor ("nəgusä nägäst") of [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia|annotation]], and a member of the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic dynasty|annotation]] who ruled under regnal name [[Zara Yaqob|Kwestantinos I|annotation]] ([[Geʽez script|Ge'ez|annotation]]: [[ቈስጠንጢኖስ|NUMBER]] "qʷastāntīnōs") or [[Zara Yaqob|Constantine I|annotation]], from the old province of [[Shewa|LOCATION]], where the capital of the Amhara emperors was located before the post-16th-century [[Oromo migrations|Oromo migrations|annotation]] and the destructive war with Gran Ahmad.

Born at [[Telq|ORGANIZATION]] in the province of Fatajar ([[now|DATE]] part of the [[Amhara Region|Amhara Region|annotation]], near the [[Awash River|Awash River|annotation]]), [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] was the youngest son of [[Dawit I|Dawit I|annotation]] and [[Dawit I|his|PERSON_coref]] youngest wife, [[Igzi Kebra|PERSON]].

The British expert on [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Edward Ullendorff|PERSON]], stated that [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] "was unquestionably the greatest ruler [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia|alias_match_match_candidate]] had seen since [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana|annotation]], during the heyday of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite|annotation]] power, and none of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] successors on the throne - excepted only the emperors [[Menelik II|Menelik II|annotation]] and [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie|annotation]] - can be compared to [[Haile Selassie|him|PERSON_coref]]."

[[Paul B. Henze|PERSON]] repeats the tradition that the jealousy of [[Paul B. Henze|his|PERSON_coref]] older brother [[Tewodros I|Tewodros I|annotation]] forced the courtiers to take [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Tigray Province|Tigray|annotation]] where [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] was brought up in secret, and educated in [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axum|alias_match_single_candidate]] and at [[Debre Abbay|the monastery|non_person_coref]] of [[Debre Abbay|Debre Abbay|annotation]].

The professor notes that [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] wrote in [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] "Mashafa Berhan" that "[[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] was brought down from the royal prison of [[Amba Geshen|Mount Gishan|annotation]] only on the eve of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] accession to the throne."

Upon the death of [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Dawit, [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] older brother [[Tewodros I|Tewodros|annotation]] ordered [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] confined on [[Amba Geshen|Amba Geshen|alias_match_match_candidate]] (around [[1414|DATE]]).

Despite this, [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]]'s supporters kept [[Zara Yaqob|him|PERSON_coref]] a perennial candidate for [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], helped by the rapid succession of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] older brothers to the throne over [[the|DURATION]] [[next 20 years|DATE]], and left [[Zara Yaqob|him|PERSON_coref]] as the oldest qualified candidate.

PERSON]] points out the effect that [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] forced seclusion had on [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] personality, "deprived of all contact with ordinary people or ordinary life.

" Thrust into a position of leadership "with no experience of the affairs of state, [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] [[[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]]] was faced by a kingdom seething with plots and rebellions, a Church riven with heresies, and outside enemies constantly threatening invasion." Buxton continues,

Although [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] became [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] in [[1434|DATE]], [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] was not crowned until [[1436|DATE]] at [[Axum|Axum|annotation]], where [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] resided for [[three years|DURATION]].

After [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] became [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] invaded the [[Hadiya Sultanate|Hadiya Sultanate|annotation]] and forcefully married the captured princess [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni|annotation]], who was baptized before their marriage.

Although [[Eleni of Ethiopia|she|PERSON_coref]] failed to bear [[Zara Yaqob|him|PERSON_coref]] any

When a conspiracy involving [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Bitwoded|annotation]]s came to light, [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] reacted by appointing [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] [[two|NUMBER]] daughters, [[Medhan Zamada|PERSON]] and [[Berhan Zamada|PERSON]], to these [[two|NUMBER]] offices.

According to the Chronicle of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] reign, the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] also appointed [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] daughters and nieces as governors over [[eight|NUMBER]] of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] provinces. These appointments were not successful.

[[Zara Yaqob|He|PERSON_coref]] defeated [[Badlay ibn Sa'ad ad-Din|Badlay ad-Din|annotation]], the Sultan of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal|annotation]] at the [[Battle of Gomit|ORGANIZATION]] in [[1445|DATE]], which consolidated [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] hold over the [[Sidama people|Sidamo|alias_match_single_candidate]] kingdoms in the south, as well as the weak Muslim kingdoms beyond the [[Awash River|Awash River|alias_match_match_candidate]].

After witnessing a bright light in the sky (which most historians have identified as [[Halley's Comet|Halley's Comet|annotation]], visible in [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[1456|DATE]]), [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] founded [[Debre Berhan|Debre Berhan|annotation]] and made it [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] capital for the remainder of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] reign.

In [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] [[later years|DURATION]], [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] became more despotic.

When [[Takla Hawariat|PERSON]], abbot of [[Debre Libanos|Dabra Libanos|annotation]], criticized [[Zara Yaqob|Yaqob|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s beatings and murder of men, [[Haile Selassie|the emperor|non_person_coref]] had the abbot himself beaten and imprisoned, where [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] died after [[few months|DURATION]].

[[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] was convinced of a plot against [[Zara Yaqob|him|PERSON_coref]] in [[1453|DATE]], which led to more brutal actions.

[[Zara Yaqob|He|PERSON_coref]] increasingly became convinced that [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] wife and children were plotting against [[Zara Yaqob|him|PERSON_coref]], and had several of them beaten.

Eventually relations between the [[two|NUMBER]] were repaired, and [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] publicly designated [[Baeda Maryam I|Baeda Maryam|alias_match_single_candidate]] as [[Baeda Maryam I|his|PERSON_coref]] successor.

At the [[time|DATE]] [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] assumed the throne, the [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Ethiopian Church|annotation]] had been divided over the issue of [[Biblical Sabbath|Biblical Sabbath|annotation]] observance for roughly [[a century|DURATION]].

[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] also continued as the defender of the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria|annotation]].

When [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] heard in [[1441|DATE]] of the destruction of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] monastery of Debre Mitmaq by [[Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq|PERSON]], the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultan of Egypt|annotation]], [[Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq|he|PERSON_coref]] called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan.

Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]]'s anger, but refused to rebuild the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic churches|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Zara Yaqob|he|PERSON_coref]] had destroyed.

[[One|NUMBER]] was "Mahsafa Berha" "The Book of Light", an exposition of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] ecclesiastical reforms and a defence of [[Zara Yaqob|his|PERSON_coref]] religious beliefs; the others were "Mahsafa Milad" "The Book of Nativity" and "Mahsafa [[Haile Selassie|Selassie|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]" "The Book of the Trinity".

[[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]] sent delegates to the [[Council of Florence|Council of Florence|annotation]] in [[1441|DATE]], and established ties with the [[Holy See|Holy See|annotation]] and [[Western Christianity|Western Christianity|annotation]].

They tried to explain that nowhere in [[Zara Yaqob|Zara Yaqob|alias_match_article_entity]]'s list of regnal names did that title occur.

[[Zara Yaqob|He|PERSON_coref]] also sent a diplomatic mission to [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] ([[1450|DATE]]), asking for skilled labour.

Léon Gambetta

[[Léon Gambetta|Léon Gambetta|annotation]] (; [[2 April 1838|DATE]] – [[31 December 1882|DATE]]) was a [[France|French|annotation]] statesman, prominent during and after the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian War|annotation]].

Born at [[Cahors|Cahors|annotation]], [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] is said to have inherited [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] vigour and eloquence from [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] father, a [[Genoa|Genoese|annotation]] grocer who had married a [[French people|Frenchwoman|alias_match_popular_redirect]] named Massabie.

At the age of [[fifteen|NUMBER]], [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] lost the sight of [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] right eye in an accident, and it eventually had to be removed.

Despite this handicap, [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] distinguished himself at school in [[Cahors|Cahors|alias_match_match_candidate]], and in [[1857|DATE]] went to [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]] to study law.

[[Léon Gambetta|His|PERSON_coref]] temperament gave [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] great influence among the students of the "[[Latin Quarter, Paris|Quartier latin|annotation]]", and [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] was soon known as an inveterate enemy of the imperial government.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] was called to the bar in [[1859|DATE]].

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] was admitted to the [[Conférence Molé-Tocqueville|Conférence Molé|annotation]] in [[1861|DATE]] and wrote to [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] father, "It is no mere lawyers club, but a veritable political assembly with a left, a right, a center; legislative proposals are the sole subject of discussion.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]], like many other [[France|French|alias_match_single_candidate]] orators, learned the art of public speaking at the Molé.

However, although [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] contributed to a Liberal review edited by [[Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour|Challemel-Lacour|annotation]], [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] did not make much of an impression until, on [[17 November 1868|DATE]], [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] was selected to defend the journalist [[Louis Charles Delescluze|Delescluze|annotation]].

[[Louis Charles Delescluze|Delescluze|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] was being prosecuted for having promoted a monument to the representative [[Baudin|PERSON]], who had been killed while resisting the "coup d'état" of [[1851|DATE]], and [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] seized [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] opportunity to attack both the "coup d'état" and the government with a vigour which made [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] immediately famous.

In [[May 1869|DATE]], [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] was elected to the Assembly, both by a district in [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]] and another in [[Marseille|Marseille|annotation]], defeating [[Hippolyte Carnot|Hippolyte Carnot|annotation]] for the former constituency and [[Adolphe Thiers|Adolphe Thiers|annotation]] and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps|Ferdinand de Lesseps|annotation]] for the latter.

Early in [[Ferdinand de Lesseps|his|PERSON_coref]] political career, [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] was influenced by "Le Programme de [[Belleville|LOCATION]]", the [[seventeen|NUMBER]] statutes that defined the radical program in [[French Third Republic|French|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] politics throughout the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic|annotation]].

This made [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] the leading defender of the lower classes in the [[Corps Législatif|LOCATION]].

On [[17 January 1870|DATE]], [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] spoke out against naming a new Imperial Lord Privy Seal, putting [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] into direct conflict with the regime's de facto prime minister, [[Émile Ollivier|Emile Ollivier|annotation]].

(see Reinach, J., "Discours et plaidoyers politiques de M. [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]]", I.[[102|NUMBER]] – [[113|NUMBER]]) [[Léon Gambetta|His|PERSON_coref]] powerful oratory caused a complete breakdown of order in the [[Corps|LOCATION]].

The Monarchist Right continually tried to interrupt [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] speech, only to have [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]]'s supporters on the Left attack them.

The disagreement reached a high point when M. le [[Président Schneider|PERSON]] asked [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] to bring [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] supporters back into order.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] responded, thundering, "l'indignation exclut le calme!"

([[Reinach|ORGANIZATION]], "Discours et plaidoyers politiques de M. [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]]", I.[[112|NUMBER]])

It is also in [[1869|DATE]] that [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] is initiated into [[Freemasonry|Freemasonry|annotation]] at [[″|NUMBER]]La Réforme″ lodge in [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]], sponsored by [[Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès|Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès|annotation]].

At [[first|ORDINAL]] [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] was opposed to [[Franco-Prussian War|the war|non_person_coref]] with [[Prussia|Prussia|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] did not, like some of [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] colleagues, refuse to vote for funds for the army, but took a patriotic line and accepted that [[Franco-Prussian War|the war|non_person_coref]] had been forced on [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]].

When the news of the disaster at [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan|annotation]] reached [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] called for strong measures.

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] proclaimed the deposition of the emperor at the "corps législatif", and the establishment of a republic at the "Hôtel de Ville".

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[first|ORDINAL]] members of the new [[Government of National Defense|Government of National Defense|annotation]], becoming [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior|annotation]].

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] advised [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] colleagues to leave [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]] and run [[Government of National Defense|the government|non_person_coref]] from some provincial city.

This advice was rejected because of fear of another revolution in [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]], and a delegation to organize resistance in the provinces was dispatched to [[Tours|Tours|annotation]], but when this was seen to be ineffective, [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] himself left [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_popular_entity]] [[7 October|DATE]] in a coal gas-filled balloon—the ""Armand-Barbès""—and upon arriving at [[Tours|Tours|alias_match_match_candidate]] took control as minister of the interior and of war.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] had hoped for a republican majority in [[François Achille Bazaine|the general|non_person_coref]] elections on [[8 February 1871|DATE]].

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] had won elections in [[eight|NUMBER]] different "départements", but the ultimate victor was the Orléanist [[Adolphe Thiers|Adolphe Thiers|annotation]], winner of [[twenty-three|NUMBER]] elections.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]], disgusted with the [[Assembly|ORGANIZATION]]'s unwillingness to fight resigned and quit [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] for [[San Sebastián|San Sebastián|annotation]] in [[Spain|Spain|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

While in [[San Sebastián|San Sebastián|annotation]], [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] walked the beaches daily, [[Franco-Prussian War|the war|non_person_coref]]m sea winds of [[early spring|DATE]] doing little to refresh [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] mind.

Despite [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] earlier career, [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] voiced [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] opposition to the [[Paris Commune|Commune|alias_match_single_candidate]] in a letter to [[Antonin Proust|Antonin Proust|annotation]], [[Antonin Proust|his|PERSON_coref]] former secretary while [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior|alias_match_single_candidate]], in which [[Antonin Proust|he|PERSON_coref]] referred to the [[Paris Commune|Commune|alias_match_single_candidate]] as "les horribles aventures dans lesquelles s’engage ce qui reste de cette malheureuse [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] - the ghastly madness blighting what remains of our poor [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] "

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]]'s stance has been explained by reference to [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] status as a republican lawyer, who fought from the bar instead of the barricade and also to [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] father having been a grocer in [[Marseille|Marseille|annotation]].

As a small-scale producer during [[the decades of the|DATE]] [[Second Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution|annotation]] in [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]], Joseph [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] was nearly ruined by the competition of new chain-store food shops.

On [[24 June 1871|DATE]], a letter was sent by [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] to [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] Parisian confidant, Dr. Édouard Fieuzal:

(Lettres de [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]], no. [[122|NUMBER]])"

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to the political stage and won on [[three|NUMBER]] separate ballots.

On [[5 November 1871|DATE]] [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] established a journal, "[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|La Republique française|annotation]]", which soon became the most influential in [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Léon Gambetta|His|PERSON_coref]] public speeches were more effective than those delivered in the Assembly, especially the [[one|NUMBER]] at [[Bordeaux|Bordeaux|annotation]].

[[Léon Gambetta|His|PERSON_coref]] turn towards moderate republicanism [[first|ORDINAL]] became apparent in [[Firminy|LOCATION]], a small coal-mining town along the [[Loire|Loire|annotation]] River.

There, [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] boldly proclaimed the radical republic [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] [[once|DATE]] supported to be "avoided like the plague" ("se tenir éloignés comme de la peste") (Discours, III[[.5|NUMBER]]).

From there, [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] went to [[Grenoble|Grenoble|annotation]].

On [[26 September 1872|DATE]], [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] proclaimed [[the future|DATE]] of the [[French Third Republic|Republic|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] to be in the hands of "a new social level" ("une couche sociale nouvelle") (Discours, III[[.101|NUMBER]]), ostensibly the petite bourgeoisie to which [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] father belonged.

When [[Adolphe Thiers|Adolphe Thiers|annotation]] resigned in [[May 1873|DATE]], and a Royalist, [[Patrice de MacMahon|Marshal MacMahon|annotation]], was placed at [[Adolphe Thiers|the head|non_person_coref]] of [[Government of National Defense|the government|non_person_coref]], [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] urged [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] friends to a moderate course.

By [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] tact, parliamentary dexterity and eloquence, [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] was instrumental in voting in the [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875|French Constitutional Laws of 1875|annotation]] in February 1875.

[[Léon Gambetta|He|PERSON_coref]] gave this policy the appropriate name of "opportunism," and became [[one|NUMBER]] of the leader of the "[[Opportunist Republicans|Opportunist Republicans|annotation]]."

On [[4 May 1877|DATE]], [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] denounced "clericalism" as the enemy.

During the [[16 May 1877|DATE]] crisis, [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]], in a speech at [[Lille|Lille|annotation]] on [[15 August|DATE]] called on [[Patrice de MacMahon|President MacMahon|alias_match_single_candidate]] "se soumettre ou se démettre", to submit to parliament's majority or to resign.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] then campaigned to rouse the republican party throughout [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]], which culminated in a speech at Romans ([[18 September 1878|DATE]]) formulating its programme.

[[Patrice de MacMahon|MacMahon|alias_match_single_candidate]], unwilling both to resign and to provoke civil war, had no choice but to dismiss [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] advisers and form a moderate republican ministry under the premiership of [[Jules Armand Dufaure|Dufaure|annotation]].

When the downfall of the [[Jules Armand Dufaure|Dufaure|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] cabinet brought about [[Patrice de MacMahon|MacMahon|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s resignation, [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] declined to become a candidate for the presidency, but supported [[Jules Grévy|Jules Grévy|annotation]]; nor did [[Jules Grévy|he|PERSON_coref]] attempt to form a ministry, but accepted the office of president of the chamber of deputies in [[January 1879|DATE]].

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] was unwillingly asked by [[Jules Grévy|Grévy|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] on [[24 November 1881|DATE]] to form a ministry, known as "Le Grand Ministère".

Had [[Jules Grévy|he|PERSON_coref]] remained in office, [[Jules Grévy|he|PERSON_coref]] would have cultivated the British alliance and cooperated with [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] in [[Egypt|Egypt|LOCATION_popular_entity]]; and when the succeeding [[Charles de Freycinet|Freycinet|annotation]] government shrank from that enterprise only to see it undertaken with signal success by [[United Kingdom|Britain|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] alone, [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]]'s foresight was quickly justified.

On [[31 December 1882|DATE]], at [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] house in Ville d'Avray, near [[Sèvres|Sèvres|annotation]], [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] died from intestine or stomach cancer.

Even though [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] was wounded [[a month earlier|DATE]] from an accidental revolver discharge, the injury had not been life-threatening.

[[Five|NUMBER]] artists, [[Jules Bastien-Lepage|Jules Bastien-Lepage|annotation]], a realist painter, [[Antonin Proust|Antonin Proust|annotation]], defensor of the [[vanguard|ORGANIZATION]] who [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] had named Minister of Beaux-Arts, [[Léon Bonnat|Léon Bonnat|annotation]], an academic painter, [[Alexandre Falguière|Alexandre Falguière|annotation]], who did [[Alexandre Falguière|his|PERSON_coref]] mortuary mask, and [[Alexandre Falguière|his|PERSON_coref]] personal photographer [[Étienne Carjat|Étienne Carjat|annotation]] all sat at [[Alexandre Falguière|his|PERSON_coref]] death-bed, making [[five|NUMBER]] widely different representations of [[Alexandre Falguière|him|PERSON_coref]] which were each published by the press [[the following day|DATE]].

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] rendered [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[three|NUMBER]] inestimable services: by preserving [[her|PERSON]] self-respect through the gallantry of the resistance [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] organized during the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian War|annotation]], by [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] tact in persuading extreme partisans to accept a moderate [[French Third Republic|Republic|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], and by [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] energy in overcoming the usurpation attempted by the advisers of [[Patrice de MacMahon|Marshal MacMahon|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

[[Léon Gambetta|His|PERSON_coref]] death at [[forty-four|NUMBER]] cut short a career which had given promise of still greater things, for [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] had real statesmanship in [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] conceptions of [[the future|DATE]] of [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] country, and [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] had an eloquence which would have been potent in the education of [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] supporters.

The romance of [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] life was [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] connection with [[Léonie Léon|Léonie Léon|annotation]], the full details of which were not known to the public till [[her|PERSON]] death in [[1906|DATE]].

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] fell in love with [[her|PERSON]] in [[1871|DATE]].

[[She|PERSON]] became [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] mistress, and the liaison lasted until [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] died.

[[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] constantly urged [[her|PERSON]] to marry [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] during this period, but [[she|PERSON]] always refused, fearing to compromise [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] career; [[she|PERSON]] remained, however, [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] confidante and intimate adviser in all [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] political plans.

It seems [[she|PERSON]] had just consented to become [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] wife, and the date of the marriage had been fixed, when the accident which caused [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] death occurred in [[her|PERSON]] presence.

[[Her|PERSON]] influence on [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] was absorbing, both as lover and as politician, and the correspondence which has been published shows how much [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] depended upon [[her|PERSON]].

For example, [[she|PERSON]] claimed that an actual interview took place in [[1878|DATE]] between [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Bismarck|LOCATION]].

That [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]] after [[1875|DATE]] felt strongly that the relations between [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Germany|Germany|LOCATION_popular_entity]] might be improved, and that [[Léon Gambetta|he|PERSON_coref]] made it [[Léon Gambetta|his|PERSON_coref]] object, by travelling incognito, to become better acquainted with [[Germany|Germany|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and the adjoining states, may be accepted, but [[M. Laur|PERSON]] appears to have exaggerated the extent to which any actual negotiations took place.

On the other hand, the increased knowledge of [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta|alias_match_article_entity]]'s attitude towards European politics which later information has supplied confirms the view that in [[Léon Gambetta|him|PERSON_coref]] [[France|France|alias_match_match_candidate]] lost prematurely a master mind, whom [[she|PERSON]] could ill spare.

Lefschetz hyperplane theorem

In mathematics, specifically in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, the [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|annotation]] is a precise statement of certain relations between the shape of an algebraic variety and the shape of its subvarieties.

More precisely, [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]] says that for a variety "X" embedded in projective space and a hyperplane section "Y", the homology, cohomology, and homotopy groups of "X" determine those of "Y".

A far-reaching generalization of the hard [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] is given by the decomposition theorem.

The [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] refers to any of the following statements:

[[Solomon Lefschetz|Solomon Lefschetz|annotation]] used [[Solomon Lefschetz|his|PERSON_coref]] idea of a [[Lefschetz pencil|Lefschetz pencil|annotation]] to prove [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]].

s, the [[Morse|PERSON]] lemma implies that there is a choice of coordinate system for "X" of a particularly simple form. This coordinate system can be used to prove [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]] directly.

fine variety of complex dimension "n" (and thus real dimension [[2|NUMBER]]"n") has the homotopy type of a [[CW complex|CW-complex|annotation]] of (real) dimension "n". This implies that the relative homology groups of "Y" in "X" are trivial in degree less than "n". The long exact sequence of relative homology then gives [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]].

Neither [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s proof nor Andreotti and [[Frankel|PERSON]]'s proof directly imply the [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] for homotopy groups.

. An application of [[Morse theory|Morse theory|alias_match_match_candidate]] to this section implies that "X" can be constructed from "Y" by adjoining cells of dimension "n" or more. From this, it follows that the relative homology and homotopy groups of "Y" in "X" are concentrated in degrees "n" and higher, which yields [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]].

Therefore, [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]] follows from applying the [[Kodaira vanishing theorem|Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem|annotation]] to and using a long exact sequence.

Combining this proof with the universal coefficient theorem nearly yields the usual [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] for cohom

Up to some restrictions on the constructible sheaf, the [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] remains true for constructible sheaves in positive characteristic.

[[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]] can also be generalized to intersection homology.

In this setting, [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|the theorem|non_person_coref]] holds for highly singular spaces.

This is the hard [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]], christened in French by [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] more colloquially as the "Théorème de [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] vache".

It immediately implies the injectivity part of the [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|alias_match_article_entity]].

The hard [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] in fact holds for any compact [[Kähler manifold|Kähler manifold|annotation]], with the isomorphism in de Rham cohomology given by multiplication by a power of the class of the [[Kähler manifold|Kähler form|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

The hard [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem|Lefschetz theorem|alias_match_article_entity]] was proven for -adic cohomology of smooth projective varieties over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic by .

Frederick Gowland Hopkins

[[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins|annotation]] ([[20 June 1861|DATE]] – [[16 May 1947|DATE]]) was an English biochemist who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|annotation]] in [[1929|DATE]], with [[Christiaan Eijkman|Christiaan Eijkman|annotation]], for the discovery of vitamins, even though [[Casimir Funk|Casimir Funk|annotation]], a Polish biochemist, is widely credited with discovering vitamins.

[[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was born in [[Eastbourne|Eastbourne|annotation]], [[Sussex|Sussex|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and educated at the [[City of London School|City of London School|annotation]] completing [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|his|PERSON_coref]] further study with the [[University of London Worldwide|University of London External Programme|annotation]] and the medical school at [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's Hospital|annotation]] which is [[now|DATE]] part of [[King's College London|King's College London|annotation]] School of [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Medicine|alias_match_single_candidate]].

After graduating, [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] then taught physiology and toxicology at [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's Hospital|annotation]] from [[1894|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1898|DATE]].

In [[1898|DATE]], while attending a meeting of the [[The Physiological Society|Physiological Society|annotation]], [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|he|PERSON_coref]] was invited by Sir [[Michael Foster|Michael Foster|PERSON_human_disambiguation]] to join the [[Physiological Laboratory|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Cambridge|Cambridge|LOCATION_popular_entity]] to investigate the chemical aspects of physiology.

[[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had for a long time studied how cells obtain energy via a complex metabolic process of oxidation and reduction reactions.

In [[1912|DATE]] [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] published the work for which [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|he|PERSON_coref]] is best known, demonstrating in a series of animal feeding experiments that diets consisting of pure proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and water fail to support animal growth.

This led [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|him|PERSON_coref]] to suggest the existence in normal diets of tiny quantities of as yet unidentified substances that are essential for animal growth and survival.

These hypothetical substances [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|he|PERSON_coref]] called "accessory food factors", later renamed vitamins.

For [[1632|DATE]], "Albion's Triumph," another masque written by [[Aurelian Townshend|Townshend|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and dedicated to the [[Charles I of England|King|alias_match_single_candidate]], had been staged on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night|annotation]][[, 6|TIME]] [[January|DATE]]; "[[Tempe Restored|Tempe Restored|alias_match_article_entity]]," a masque dedicated to Queen [[Henrietta Maria|Henrietta Maria|annotation]], followed [[a month later|DATE]].

"[[Tempe Restored|Tempe Restored|alias_match_article_entity]]" was another step in the process of women appearing onstage in [[England|England|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The role of women in "[[Tempe Restored|Tempe Restored|alias_match_article_entity]]" has drawn the attention of modern critics.

The Venetian ambassador to the [[Stuart Court|PERSON]], who witnessed "[[Tempe Restored|Tempe Restored|alias_match_article_entity]]," described it in a letter as "a sumptuous masque performed with wonderfully rich decorations."

The English composer [[Henry Lawes|Henry Lawes|annotation]] appeared in "[[Tempe Restored|Tempe Restored|alias_match_article_entity]]," and [[two years later|DATE]] composed the music for [[John Milton|John Milton|annotation]]'s masque "Comus" ([[1634|DATE]]).

Superliga Argentina (association)

The [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga Argentina de Fútbol|annotation]], (officially "[[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]] Profesional del Fútbol Argentino") was an [[Argentina|Argentine|annotation]] sports association responsible for administering the main professional league of [[Argentines|Argentine|alias_match_popular_redirect]] football, the [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División|annotation]], between [[2017|DATE]] [[and|DATE]] [[2020|DATE]].

The [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]] was contractually bound to the [[Argentine Football Association|Argentine Football Association|annotation]], although it operated as an autonomous body and had its own statute.

In [[2016|DATE]], the [[Argentine Football Association|Association|alias_match_single_candidate]] approved the creation of a new entity, named "[[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga Argentina de Fútbol|alias_match_article_entity]]", which would take over the organisation of the [[two|NUMBER]] main leagues in [[Argentines|Argentine|alias_match_popular_redirect]] football, [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División|annotation]] and [[Primera Nacional|Primera B Nacional|annotation]] championships.

Nevertheless, in [[February 2017|DATE]], the [[Argentine Football Association|AFA|alias_match_single_candidate]] modified its statute, giving [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]] rights to organise only the [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División|alias_match_single_candidate]] tournaments and excluding [[Primera Nacional|Primera B Nacional|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], which remained organised by the main body.

The main football leagues of [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] (such as [[Premier League|English Premier League|annotation]] or Spanish [[La Liga|La Liga|annotation]], organised by associations dedicated exclusively to that championships and operating as separate entities from their respective National Associations) served as inspiration for the creation of the [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]].

From the [[2017|DATE]]–[[18|NUMBER]] season, the "[[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga Argentina|alias_match_article_entity]]" took over the organisation of [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] championships since then on.

The [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]], through the [[Board of Directors|ORGANIZATION]] and with the advice of the [[Competencies Management|ORGANIZATION]], was the only competent entity to establish all the obligations, guidelines and instructions that must be met by the participating clubs of [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] on all aspects of the tournament, including those relating to protocol, commercial rights, advertising, press, accreditations.

The [[Superliga Argentina (association)|SAF|alias_match_article_entity]] also awarded winning teams with trophies especially created for the occasion.

In [[February 2020|DATE]], President of [[Argentine Football Association|AFA|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Claudio Tapia|PERSON]] stated that the [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]] had been established to position [[Argentines|Argentine|alias_match_popular_redirect]] football as a product, but it failed in that purpose.

[[One month|DURATION]] after those announcements, the president of the [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Mariano Elizondo|PERSON]], resigned.

The [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]] was replaced by a similar body, named "[[Argentine Primera División|Liga Profesional de Fútbol|alias_match_single_candidate]]", directly linked to [[Argentine Football Association|AFA|alias_match_single_candidate]] and presided by [[Marcelo Tinelli|Marcelo Tinelli|annotation]].

It was expected that [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga|alias_match_article_entity]] would be dissolved [[once|DATE]] the [[2020 Copa de la Superliga|2020 edition|annotation]] of [[Copa de la Superliga|Copa de la Superliga Argentina|annotation]] finished, but due to [[COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina|COVID-19 pandemic|annotation]] the cup was cancelled, accelerating times.

Emperor Zhaozong of Tang

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|annotation]] ([[March 31|DATE]], [[867|NUMBER]] – [[September 22|DATE]], [[904|NUMBER]]), né [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|annotation]], name later changed to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Min|annotation]] and again to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Ye|annotation]], was the penultimate emperor of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty|annotation]] of [[History of China|China|annotation]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|He|PERSON_coref]] reigned from [[888|NUMBER]] [[to|NUMBER]] [[904|NUMBER]] (although [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] was briefly deposed by the eunuch [[Liu Jishu|Liu Jishu|annotation]] in [[900|NUMBER]] and restored in [[901|NUMBER]]).

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] was the [[seventh|ORDINAL]] son of [[Emperor Yizong of Tang|Emperor Yizong of Tang|annotation]] and younger brother of [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong of Tang|annotation]].

Later [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] was murdered by [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Wen|annotation]], the Later Liang ruler who overthrew the [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynasty|alias_match_match_candidate]].

During [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s reign, the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] fell into total disarray and rebellions, which had been ongoing since the reign of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] older brother [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]], as they erupted throughout the country while the imperial government's authority effectively disappeared.

In the midst of all this, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] tried to salvage the dying dynasty.

However, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] efforts to reassert imperial power, generally backfired, as [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] unsuccessful campaigns against [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|annotation]], [[Chen Jingxuan|Chen Jingxuan|annotation]], and [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|annotation]], merely allowed them to re-affirm their power.

Eventually, the major warlord [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong|annotation]] seized control of the imperial government and in [[904|NUMBER]] had [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] killed as the prelude of taking over the [[Tang dynasty|Tang|alias_match_single_candidate]] throne.

Zhu also killed many of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s ministers, including the chancellor, [[Cui Yin|Cui Yin|annotation]].

Zhu then placed [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[13-year-old|DURATION]] son as a puppet emperor (as [[Emperor Ai of Tang|Emperor Ai|annotation]]).

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s reign lasted almost [[16 years|DURATION]] and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] was buried in Heling (和陵).

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|He|PERSON_coref]] was [[37|NUMBER]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[867|NUMBER]], during the reign of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] father [[Emperor Yizong of Tang|Emperor Yizong|annotation]], in the eastern palace at the imperial capital [[Chang'an|Chang'an|annotation]].

[[She|PERSON]] appeared to have died shortly after giving birth to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]].

(As [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] was also said to have been from the same mother as [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] older brother [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Li Yan|annotation]], whose mother was a different [[Consort Wang|Consort Wang|PERSON_human_disambiguation]], it might have been that [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] was raised by [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Li Yan|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s mother.)

In [[872|NUMBER]], [[Emperor Yizong of Tang|Emperor Yizong|alias_match_single_candidate]] created [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] the Prince of [[Shou|ORGANIZATION]].

In [[877|NUMBER]], by which time [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Li Yan|alias_match_single_candidate]] (named [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Li Xuan|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] by this point) was emperor (as [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]]), [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] was given the honorary titles of "Kaifu Yitong Sansi" ([[開府儀同三司|NUMBER]]), commandant at You Prefecture (幽州, in modern [[Beijing|Beijing|annotation]]), and military governor ("[[Jiedushi|Jiedushi|annotation]]") of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered at [[Beijing|Beijing|alias_match_match_candidate]]).

It was said that [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] was particularly close to [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]] since they shared the same mother, and [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] followed [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]] in flight from [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] from the attack of the agrarian rebels led by [[Huang Chao|Huang Chao|annotation]] in [[880|NUMBER]].

While on this flight, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]], who was then [[13|NUMBER]], ran out of energy and requested a horse from the eunuch [[Tian Lingzi|Tian Lingzi|annotation]], who dominated [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s court; Tian refused and whipped [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]]'s attendant for the request.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] thereafter bore a deep resentment for Tian.

It was said that [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s younger brother and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]]'s older brother [[Li Bao|PERSON]] ([[李保|NUMBER]]) the Prince of Ji was the oldest among [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s surviving brothers and was considered wise, and so the imperial officials wanted [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] to succeed [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]], but the powerful eunuch [[Yang Fugong|Yang Fugong|annotation]] (who had succeeded Tian as the surveyor of [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]-controlled [[Shence Army|Shence Armies|annotation]]) wanted [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] to succeed [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]], so [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]] issued an edict creating [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]] crown prince.

Shortly after, [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]] died, and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Jie|alias_match_article_entity]], changing [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] name to [[Li Min|Li Min|PERSON_human_disambiguation]], took the throne as [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s ascension created great anticipation in the people's minds, as [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] was considered intelligent, handsome, decisive, and talented, with ambitions to restore imperial power that had been lost during [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s reign.

Not long after taking the throne, [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] changed [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] name further to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Li Ye|alias_match_article_entity]].

As soon as [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] took the throne, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] received petitions from [[Wang Jian (Former Shu)|Wang Jian|annotation]] and [[Gu Yanlang|Gu Yanlang|annotation]], advocating that [[Tian Lingzi|Tian Lingzi|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s brother [[Chen Jingxuan|Chen Jingxuan|annotation]] the military governor of [[Xichuan Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] (西川, headquartered in modern [[Chengdu|Chengdu|annotation]], [[Sichuan|Sichuan|annotation]]), be removed from [[Chen Jingxuan|his|PERSON_coref]] post.

Still resenting Tian, who was then sheltered by [[Chen Jingxuan|Chen|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] from edicts that [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong|alias_match_single_candidate]] had [[previously|DATE]] entered ordering Tian into exile, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] ordered [[Chen Jingxuan|Chen|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] back to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] and commissioned [[Wei Zhaodu|Wei Zhaodu|alias_match_match_candidate]] as [[Wei Zhaodu|his|PERSON_coref]] replacement.

When [[Chen Jingxuan|Chen|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] refused to be replaced, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] ordered a general campaign against [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]], with Wei in command, assisted by [[Wang Jian (Former Shu)|Wang|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]], Gu, and [[Yang Fugong|Yang Fugong|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s adoptive nephew [[Yang Shouliang|Yang Shouliang|annotation]] the military governor of [[Shannan West Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] (山南西道, headquartered in modern [[Hanzhong|Hanzhong|annotation]], [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi|annotation]]).

While the campaign against Chen was starting, another campaign that had been ongoing during [[the latter years|DURATION]] of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s reign was ending.

Even though [[Yang Fugong|Yang Fugong|alias_match_match_candidate]] had been instrumental in having [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] made emperor, by [[889|NUMBER]] conflicts had begun between [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] and the chief eunuch, leading to a public argument between [[Yang Fugong|Yang|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] and the chancellors [[Kong Wei|Kong Wei|annotation]] on [[one|NUMBER]] occasion over [[Kong Wei|Kong|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s accusation that [[Yang Fugong|Yang|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was disrespecting [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]].

Nevertheless, at the suggestion of [[Kong Wei|Kong|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s colleague [[Zhang Jun (Tang chancellor)|Zhang Jun|annotation]], who advocated that a strong imperial army directly under [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] was essential for the restoration of imperial power to counteract the warlords and [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]-commanded [[Shence Army|Shence Armies|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] began recruiting an imperial army that eventually numbered [[100,000|NUMBER]] by [[spring|DATE]] [[890|NUMBER]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]], despite [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] reservations, approved the campaign, which got under way in [[summer|DATE]] [[890|NUMBER]], with Zhu's army attacking [[Zhaoyi Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] (昭義, headquartered in modern [[Changzhi|Changzhi|annotation]], [[Shanxi|Shanxi|annotation]]), then also under [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s control, from the southeast; [[Li Kuangwei|Li Kuangwei|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Helian Duo|Helian Duo|annotation]] the military governor of [[Datong Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] (大同, headquartered in modern [[Datong|Datong|annotation]], [[Shanxi|Shanxi|annotation]]) attacking from the northeast; and the main imperial army, under [[Zhang Jun (Tang chancellor)|Zhang|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s command and supplemented by the armies of various circuits around [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], attacking from the southwest.

With [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] subsequently threatening an invasion, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] was forced to restore [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[Li Keyong|his|PERSON_coref]] titles and positions and exile Zhang and Kong, ending the campaign against [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] in disaster.

With the defeat against [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]], and the campaign against [[Chen Jingxuan|Chen|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] in a stalemate—the imperial army had put [[Xichuan|Xichuan|ORGANIZATION_geo_disambiguation]]'s capital [[Chengdu|Chengdu|alias_match_match_candidate]] under siege and caused a terrible famine within [[Chengdu|the city|non_person_coref]], but had not been able to capture it—the imperial treasury was being drained, and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] decided to end the Xichuan campaign as well.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|He|PERSON_coref]] pardoned Chen and recalled Wei, while ordering Gu and Wang (for whom [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] had created a [[Yongping Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] ([[永平|NUMBER]]) out of parts of Xichuan territory) back to their circuits.

Wang was unwilling to accept this result, however, and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] intimidated Wei into returning to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] by himself, while [[Wang Jian (Former Shu)|Wang|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] continued the siege of [[Chengdu|Chengdu|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The end of the campaign against [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]], which [[Yang Fugong|Yang Fugong|alias_match_match_candidate]] had opposed, did not end the tension between [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Yang Fugong|Yang|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]], but intensified it.

In [[fall|DATE]] [[891|NUMBER]], [[Yang Fugong|Yang|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] sought to retire, and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] approved the retirement.

Soon thereafter, rumors that Yang was planning a rebellion at [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] against [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]], along with [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] adoptive nephew [[Yang Shouxin|PERSON]] ([[楊守信|NUMBER]]).

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] sent the imperial guards to preemptively attack [[Yang Fugong|Yang Fugong|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s mansion, and [[Yang Fugong|Yang Fugong|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Yang Shouxin|PERSON]] fled to [[Yang Shouliang|Yang Shouliang|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[Shannan West Circuit|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]], while inimical to the Yangs, was hesitant to give [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] more authority and territory, and therefore initially denied the request.

However, [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Wang Xingyu|Wang Xingyu|alias_match_match_candidate]] launched an attack anyway, forcing [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] into approving [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] as the commander against the [[Yangs|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] wanted to add [[Shannan West|PERSON]] to [[Li Maozhen|his|PERSON_coref]] territory, so [[Li Maozhen|he|PERSON_coref]] requested to be [[Shannan West|PERSON]]'s military governor, fully expecting that [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] would allow [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] to retain both [[Fengxiang|ORGANIZATION]] and [[Shannan West|PERSON]].

Instead, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] issued an edict making [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] the military governor of Shannan West and Wuding (武定, headquartered in modern [[Hanzhong|Hanzhong|alias_match_match_candidate]]) Circuits, while making the chancellor [[Xu Yanruo|Xu Yanruo|annotation]] the military governor of Fengxiang.

Despite the misgivings of the chancellor [[Du Rangneng|Du Rangneng|annotation]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] launched a campaign against [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]], with Du in charge of the logistics and [[Li Sizhou|PERSON]] ([[李嗣周|NUMBER]]) the Prince of [[Shaanxi|Qin|alias_match_single_candidate]] in command of the imperial guards, which [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] had rebuilt with new recruits.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] capitulated, ordering Du to commit suicide and allowing [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] to retain Fengxiang, [[Shannan West|PERSON]], [[Wuding|LOCATION]], and [[Tianxiong|ORGANIZATION]].

It was said that after this point, [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Wang Xingyu|Wang Xingyu|alias_match_match_candidate]], in alliance with the chancellor [[Cui Zhaowei|Cui Zhaowei|annotation]], were heavily influencing imperial governance, such that [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] would not dare to carry out any measures that they opposed.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] approved [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s petition and made [[Wang Ke (Tang dynasty)|Wang Ke|alias_match_single_candidate]] the military governor of Huguo.

In response, [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Wang Xingyu|Wang Xingyu|alias_match_match_candidate]], and Han marched on [[Xianyang|the capital|non_person_coref]] again, killing the chancellors [[Wei Zhaodu|Wei Zhaodu|alias_match_match_candidate]] (who had returned to chancellorship after the Xichuan campaign) and [[Li Xi (Tang dynasty)|Li Xi|annotation]], whom they perceived to be behind [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s decision.

Rumors developed that [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Wang Xingyu|Wang Xingyu|alias_match_match_candidate]] both wanted to seize [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] and take [[Wang Xingyu|him|PERSON_coref]] to their domains.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]], in response, fled into the [[Qinling|Qinling Mountains|annotation]] with [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] officials, and the people of [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] followed in droves.

[[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] and Han capitulated, sending apologies and tributes to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]], who returned to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], bestowed great honors on [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Li Keyong|his|PERSON_coref]] key subordinates, but hesitated when [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] proposed to attack [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]], believing that if [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] destroyed [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]], the balance of power would be lost.

[[Li Maozhen|He|PERSON_coref]] became suspicious of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s attempts to rebuild the imperial guards and putting them under the commands of imperial princes, including [[Li Sizhou|PERSON]], [[Li Jiepi|PERSON]] ([[李戒丕|NUMBER]]) the Prince of Yan, and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s uncle [[Li Zi|Li Zi|annotation]] the [[Prince of Tong|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] immediately sought aid from [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]], but with [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] being unable to launch an army at that time and [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s forces having defeated [[Li Sizhou|PERSON]]'s, [[Li Sizhou|PERSON]] recommended fleeing to [[Hedong|Hedong|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] initially agreed and prepared to head for Fu Prefecture (鄜州, in modern [[Yan'an|Yan'an|annotation]], [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi|annotation]]), preparing to cross the [[Yellow River|Yellow River|alias_match_match_candidate]] to [[Hedong|Hedong|ORGANIZATION_geo_disambiguation]] from there; [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] also sent [[Li Jiepi|PERSON]] to [[Hedong|Hedong|ORGANIZATION_geo_disambiguation]] to prepare for [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] arrival.

However, after [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] left [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Han Jian (Zhenguo warlord)|Han Jian|alias_match_single_candidate]] sent emissaries, and then personally arrived to meet with [[Han Jian (Zhenguo warlord)|him|PERSON_coref]], to persuade [[Han Jian (Zhenguo warlord)|him|PERSON_coref]] to go to Zhenguo's capital Hua Prefecture ([[華州|NUMBER]]) instead, promising to do all [[Han Jian (Zhenguo warlord)|he|PERSON_coref]] could to uphold imperial power.

As both [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] officials were fearful of the lengthy trek to [[Hedong|Hedong|ORGANIZATION_geo_disambiguation]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] agreed and headed for Hua Prefecture instead.

[[Once|DATE]] [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] arrived at [[Hua Prefecture|LOCATION]], however, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] became effectively under Han's control, and Han stopped any real imperial attempt to engage [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] militarily.

Further, [[Li Maozhen|he|PERSON_coref]] forced [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] to disband the imperial guards under the imperial princes' control, and, after [[Li Jiepi|PERSON]] returned from [[Hedong|Hedong|LOCATION_geo_disambiguation]]—thus exposing the fact that [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]] was in no shape to launch an army to aid [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]]—slaughtered [[11|NUMBER]] imperial princes.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] made peace with [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] in [[spring|DATE]] [[898|NUMBER]], restoring the titles that [[Li Maozhen|he|PERSON_coref]] had [[previously|DATE]] stripped from [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In [[fall|DATE]] [[898|NUMBER]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], but with no army around [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] [[now|DATE]] other than [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]-controlled [[Shence Army|Shence Armies|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

By [[900|NUMBER]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]], who had come to trust [[Cui Yin|Cui|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and who would later describe [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] as "faithful but trickier" (than [[Han Wo|Han Wo|annotation]], the official [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] was making the comment to) was planning with [[Cui Yin|Cui|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] to slaughter [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s.

Upon [[Cui Yin|Cui|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s accusations, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] ordered Wang, [[Zhu Daobi|PERSON]], and Jing to commit suicide, and it was said that from this point [[Cui Yin|Cui|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] became the leading figure at court, with [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s angry at and fearful of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]].

[[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s also had become fearful of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] himself, who, after returning from [[Hua Prefecture|LOCATION]], was described to be depressed, alcoholic, and unpredictable in [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] temperament.

After an incident in [[winter|DATE]] [[900|NUMBER]] in which [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]], in a drunken rage, killed several attending eunuchs and ladies in waiting, [[Liu Jishu|Liu Jishu|alias_match_match_candidate]] led [[Shence Army|Shence Army|alias_match_match_candidate]] troops into the palace and forced [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] to yield the throne to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] son [[Li Yu, Prince of De|Li Yu, Prince of De|annotation]] the Crown Prince.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] wife ([[Li Yu, Prince of De|Li Yu|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s mother) [[Empress He (Tang dynasty)|Empress He|annotation]] were honored as retired emperor ("[[Taishang Huang|Taishang Huang|alias_match_match_candidate]]") and retired empress ("Taishang Huanghou") but put under house arrest.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] was restored to the throne.

In gratitude to the [[three|NUMBER]] officers, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] bestowed the imperial clan name of Li on them, renaming them [[Li Jizhao|PERSON]] ([[李繼昭|NUMBER]]), [[Li Yanbi|PERSON]] ([[李彥弼|NUMBER]]), and [[Li Jihui|PERSON]] ([[李繼誨|NUMBER]]) respectively.

Shortly after [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s restoration, [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] showed an intent of reestablishing [[Li Maozhen|his|PERSON_coref]] relationship with [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] by visiting [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] to pay homage to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] therefore rejected the proposal, and put [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s [[Han Quanhui|Han Quanhui|annotation]] and [[Zhang Yanhong|PERSON]] ([[張彥弘|NUMBER]]), both of whom had [[previously|DATE]] served as eunuch monitors of the [[Fengxiang army|ORGANIZATION]], in command of the [[Shence Army|Shence Armies|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and further wanted the retired eunuch [[Yan'an|Yan|alias_match_single_candidate]] Zunmei ([[嚴遵美|NUMBER]]) to serve as the overseer of both [[Shence Army|Shence Armies|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], but [[Yan'an|Yan|alias_match_single_candidate]] declined and remained in retirement.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] was forced to again remove [[Cui Yin|Cui|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] from [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] post as the director of salt and iron monopolies.

Moreover, by this point they had persuaded [[Li Jiyun|PERSON]] and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] Fengxiang soldiers to be on their side.

Cui, realizing that [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s were intending to destroy [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]], became fearful, and wrote [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], urging [[Zhu Wen|him|PERSON_coref]] to bring troops to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] to act against [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s.

They, with the cooperation of [[Li Jiyun|PERSON]], [[Li Jihui|PERSON]], and [[Li Yanbi|PERSON]] (but not [[Li Jizhao|PERSON]], who refused to align with them), seized [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] household, and took them to [[Fengxiang|ORGANIZATION]]'s capital [[Fengxiang Municipality|ORGANIZATION]].

Cui and the imperial officials largely remained at [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], although some followed [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] and [[Yang Fugong|the eunuch|non_person_coref]]s to [[Fengxiang|ORGANIZATION]].

After Zhu arrived at [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] to confer with [[Cui Yin|Cui|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] advanced to Fengxiang and put it under siege.

In [[spring|DATE]] [[903|NUMBER]], [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] sued for peace with Zhu, surrendering [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] and the imperial household to [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] while killing Han and the other leading eunuchs, as well as [[Li Jiyun|PERSON]], [[Li Jihui|PERSON]], and [[Li Yanbi|PERSON]].

Zhu took [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]] back to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], where [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[first|ORDINAL]] actions Zhu and Cui carried out was to slaughter the remaining eunuchs, regardless of whether they supported Han's actions.

After [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Luoyang|the capital|non_person_coref]] became under the military control of the [[Xuanwu|LOCATION]] contingent; while [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] himself returned to [[Xuanwu|LOCATION]]'s capital [[Kaifeng|Daliang|annotation]], [[Zhu Wen|he|PERSON_coref]] left [[Zhu Wen|his|PERSON_coref]] nephew [[Zhu Youlun|PERSON]] ([[朱友倫|NUMBER]]) in command at [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Then, citing the possibility that [[Li Maozhen|Li Maozhen|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Li Maozhen|his|PERSON_coref]] adoptive son [[Li Jihui|Li Jihui|annotation]] (not the same person as the [[one|NUMBER]] killed in [[903|NUMBER]]) the military governor of [[Jingnan Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] may attack [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Li Maozhen|he|PERSON_coref]] forced [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] to abandon [[Chang'an|Chang'an|alias_match_match_candidate]] and move [[Luoyang|the capital|non_person_coref]] to [[Luoyang|Luoyang|alias_match_match_candidate]].

While on the journey to [[Luoyang|Luoyang|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] sent secret orders to [[Wang Jian (Former Shu)|Wang Jian|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Yang Xingmi|Yang Xingmi|annotation]] the military governor of [[Huainan Circuit|ORGANIZATION]] (淮南, headquartered in modern [[Yangzhou|Yangzhou|annotation]], [[Huainan|Huainan|annotation]]), and [[Li Keyong|Li Keyong|alias_match_match_candidate]], asking them to start a campaign against [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], but [[Zhu Wen|his|PERSON_coref]] orders drew no immediate reactions.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] resisted Zhu's wishes on this issue.

Zhu became apprehensive that, as [[Yang Xingmi|he|PERSON_coref]] battled other warlords in campaigns, [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]] might find a way to rise against [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|him|PERSON_coref]] at [[Luoyang|Luoyang|alias_match_match_candidate]], and therefore resolved to remove [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|the emperor|non_person_coref]].

In [[fall|DATE]] [[904|NUMBER]], [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|he|PERSON_coref]] had [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] associate [[Jiang Xuanhui|PERSON]] ([[蔣玄暉|NUMBER]]), along with [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|his|PERSON_coref]] adoptive son [[Zhu Yougong|PERSON]] ([[朱友恭|NUMBER]]) and officer [[Shi Shucong|PERSON]] ([[氏叔琮|NUMBER]]), take soldiers to the palace and assassinate [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]].

Jiang initially issued a declaration blaming the assassination on [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s concubines [[Pei Zhenyi|PERSON]] ([[裴貞一|NUMBER]]) and [[Li Jianrong|PERSON]] ([[李漸榮|NUMBER]]), but Zhu later blamed it on [[Zhu Yougong|LOCATION]] and [[Shi|PERSON]] and forced them to commit suicide.

[[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong|alias_match_article_entity]]'s son [[Emperor Ai of Tang|Li Zuo|annotation]] the [[Prince of Hui|ORGANIZATION]] was [[first|ORDINAL]] declared crown prince, and then emperor (as [[Emperor Ai of Tang|Emperor Ai|alias_match_single_candidate]]).

The Hu family of Xidi are descended from [[Hu Shiliang|PERSON]], from [[Wuyuan|LOCATION]], who was a descendant of [[Hu Changyi|PERSON]], a son of [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|alias_match_article_entity]] who was adopted by the [[Wuyuan|LOCATION]] Hu family.

[[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]] was born in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, New Jersey|annotation]] in [[1953|DATE]].

[[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] grew up in an [[African Americans|African American|annotation]] community near the [[Detroit Institute of Arts|Detroit Institute of Art|annotation]] ([[Detroit Institute of Art|DIA|acronym]]) in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan|annotation]].

Alicia attended the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California Santa Cruz|annotation]] earning [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts|annotation]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA|alias_match_single_candidate]]) in Teaching Aesthetic Awareness from a Cultural Perspective, with a Bilingual Cross-Cultural Emphasis Credential in [[1979|DATE]].

Alicia also received [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] Single Subjects Credential in Art Education in [[1980|DATE]].

[[Three years later|DATE]], in [[1983|DATE]], [[Juana Alicia|Alicia|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] earned [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] [[Fifth Year Certificate in Bilingual Education|ORGANIZATION]], and received [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] [[Master of Fine Arts|Master of Fine Arts|annotation]] ([[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A|alias_match_single_candidate]].) in Drawing and Painting from [[San Francisco Art Institute|San Francisco Art Institute|annotation]] ([[San Francisco Art Institute|SFAI|alias_match_single_candidate]]) in [[May 1990|DATE]].

In [[1972|DATE]], [[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]] was recruited by labor organizer [[Cesar Chavez|PERSON]] on [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Cesar Chavez|his|PERSON_coref]] national speaking tours, to work for the [[United Farm Workers|United Farmworkers Union|ORGANIZATION_redirect_candidate]] as an artist.

[[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] moved to [[Salinas, California|Salinas, California|annotation]] during the peak of the [[United Farm Workers|United Farm Worker Movement|annotation]].

Instead of doing direct cultural work, [[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]] went to work in the agricultural fields as a field organizer.

During the strikes in [[Salinas, California|Salinas|alias_match_single_candidate]] in [[1973|DATE]] and [[1976|DATE]], [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] worked for FreshPict, a strawberry grower.

[[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] also worked for [[Interharvest|ORGANIZATION]], a [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit|annotation]]-owned lettuce company.

[[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] worked up until [[September 1976|DATE]] in the fields but then stopped because at the [[time|DATE]] [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] was [[seven months|DURATION]] pregnant with [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] son and was exposed to pesticide poisoning.

The poisoning led to chronic pneumonia which [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] suffered for [[several years|DURATION]].

After working in the fields, [[Juana Alicia|Alicia|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] worked as a paraprofessional in a bilingual classroom next to the hiring hall for the [[United Farm Workers|United Farm Workers|annotation]].

[[Juana Alicia|Her|PERSON_coref]] son was born in [[December 1976|DATE]] and [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] never went back to work in the fields.

In [[1981|DATE]], [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] moved to the [[Mission District of San Francisco|LOCATION]] and began to exhibit [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] art, all while working outside of the arts to make ends meet.

[[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]] has taught at [[Stanford University|Stanford University|annotation]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California Santa Cruz|annotation]], [[University of California, Davis|University of California Davis|annotation]], [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State University|annotation]], and [[Berkeley City College|Berkeley City College|annotation]].

Dedicated to the development of young artists, [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] co-founded and co-directed the [[San Francisco|San Francisco|alias_match_popular_entity]] Early Childhood School for the Creative [[Bachelor of Arts|Arts|alias_match_single_candidate]] and the East Bay Center for Urban [[Bachelor of Arts|Arts|alias_match_single_candidate]].

Through [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] teaching jobs, [[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]] has fostered several generations of young muralists and activist artists.

Through [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] art, [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] attempts to convey a sense of shared humanity and appreciation for the environment.

Alicia paints in a style that blends realism, abstraction and surrealism together, as needed depending on [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] subject matter.

[[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] big mural project in [[San Francisco|San Francisco|alias_match_popular_entity]] was "Las Lechugeras" (The Women Lettuce Workers).

Alicia came up with a design and immediately [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] faced criticism that seemed insensitive and racist, but [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] stood by [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] work and the design was approved and became the final mural.

[[One|NUMBER]] of the women is pregnant (and [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] uterus is transparent, allowing the viewer to see the fetus) and the others are picking lettuce, wrapping it in plastic or looking out at the field.

[[Juana Alicia|Her|PERSON_coref]] experience as a female f

l. In addition, [[Juana Alicia|Alicia|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] intended the mural to be for the largely Latino neighborhood where [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] painted i

t. [[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] also wanted viewers, especially [[African Americans|American|alias_match_single_candidate]] viewers, to think about where their food comes from and who is involved in its production. "Las Lechugeras" is also significant because of its feminist message in its depiction of strong women at work. It also has a strong environmental and human rights message signified by the crop duster which sprays the workers with no regard to health.

Alicia has tried several times to raise money to restore the mural, although [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] would prefer to do a permanent mosaic based on the mural in its place.

Coincidentally, this opened way for [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] project that was much related to " Las Lechugeras".

[[Juana Alicia|Alicia|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s "Alto al Fuego" is a mural which deals with the subject of violence.

The mural takes its title from the widespread [[La Llorona|Mexican|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] myth of a woman who allegedly drowned [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] children and spends the rest of [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] life weeping for them.

[[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] created [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] in [[the spring of 2004|DATE]] at the corners of [[York|York|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[24th|ORDINAL]] Streets.

In [[2007|DATE]], [[Stanford University|Stanford|annotation]]'s Centro [[Chicano|Chicano|alias_match_match_candidate]] wrote to [[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]], offering a new commission for the Centro.

Since a mural that [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] had created with the [[Yo Puedo Program|ORGANIZATION]] during the mig-eighties had been destroyed during a renovation.

The Centro requested that [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] create a new work of art in its place.

After touring the site, [[Juana Alicia|Juana Alicia|alias_match_article_entity]] drew up several proposals for th exterior and interior walls.

[[Juana Alicia|She|PERSON_coref]] proposed an exterior mural that resembled [[Juana Alicia|her|PERSON_coref]] work [[Juana Alicia|she|PERSON_coref]] had [[recently|DATE]] created for the [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California, San Francisco|annotation]] ([[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) Medical Center in [[San Francisco|San Francisco|alias_match_popular_entity]] and in [[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_match_candidate]] at the [[Metropolitan University of Technology|Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana|annotation]] ([[Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana|UTM|acronym]]).

Wrexham

[[Wrexham|Wrexham|annotation]] ( ; [[Wrexham|Wrecsam|alias_match_article_entity]]; ) is a large market town and the administrative centre of the [[Wrexham County Borough|Wrexham County Borough|annotation]] in [[Wales|Wales|annotation]], [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom|annotation]].

[[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] is located between the [[Wales|Welsh|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] mountains and the lower [[River Dee, Wales|Dee Valley|annotation]] alongside the neighbouring county of [[Cheshire|Cheshire|annotation]].

Historically part of [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire|annotation]], [[Wrexham|the town|non_person_coref]] became part of [[Clwyd|Clwyd|annotation]] in [[1974|DATE]] and since [[1996|DATE]] has been the principal centre of [[Wrexham County Borough|Wrexham County Borough|annotation]].

[[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] has historically been [[one|NUMBER]] of the primary settlements of [[Wales|Wales|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Wrexham|the town|non_person_coref]] comprises the local government communities of [[Acton, Wrexham|Acton|annotation]], [[Caia Park|Caia Park|annotation]], Offa and [[Rhosddu|Rhosddu|annotation]].

[[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] was likely founded prior to [[the 11th century|DATE]] and in the Middle Ages developed as a regional centre for trade and administration.

Prior to de-industrialisation in [[the 20th century|DATE]], [[Wrexham|the town|non_person_coref]] and surrounding area were a hub of coal and lead mining; the production of iron, steel and leather; and brewing.

[[Today|DATE]], [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] continues to serve north [[Wales|Wales|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[Wales|Welsh|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] borderlands as a centre for manufacturing, retail, education and administration.

[[Wrexham|the town|non_person_coref]] is noted for hosting [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham A.F.C.|annotation]] ([[one|NUMBER]] of the oldest professional football teams in the world); the nationally significant industrial heritage of the [[Clywedog Valley|LOCATION]]; the celebrated [[Wales|National|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Trust Property of [[Erddig|Erddig|annotation]]; and the fine [[Tudor|PERSON]] church of [[St Giles' Church, Wrexham|St Giles|annotation]], which towers over the historic town centre.

Human activity in the [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] area dates back to the [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic|annotation]] period ([[8000|NUMBER]] to [[4300 BC|DATE]]), with tools made from flint being found to the east of [[Wrexham|the town|non_person_coref]].

A series of [[Iron Age|Iron Age|annotation]] hill-forts are located to the west of present-day [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] along the upland-lowland line suggesting the presence of an ancient tribal boundary.

At the [[time|DATE]] of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest of Britain|annotation]], the area which [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] formed part of was held by a tribe called the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii|annotation]].

A [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] civilian settlement was located in the [[Plas Coch|Plas Coch|annotation]] area of [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] and excavations have revealed evidence of agriculture and trade with the wider [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] world.

Following the end of [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] rule in [[United Kingdom|Britain|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] formed part of the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British|annotation]] Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys|annotation]].

During this [[first|ORDINAL]] period of [[Mercia|Mercian|alias_match_single_candidate]] advance in [[the 8th century|DATE]], the settlement of [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] was likely founded on the flat ground above the meadows of the [[River Gwenfro|River Gwenfro|annotation]].

The name [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] probably comes from the old [[United Kingdom|English|alias_match_single_candidate]] for [[Wryhtel|ORGANIZATION]]'s river meadow.

The [[Mercia|Mercians|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] fought over north-east [[Wales|Wales|alias_match_match_candidate]] during the [[8th|ORDINAL]] to [[10th centuries|DATE]] but the [[Wales|Welsh|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] re-conquered the [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] area during [[the 11th century|DATE]].

Following the [[Wales|Welsh|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] reconquest, [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] formed an integral part of the [[Powys|Powys|alias_match_popular_entity]] lordship of [[Maelor|Maelor|annotation]] and so does not appear in the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Book|annotation]] of [[1086|DATE]].

The [[first|ORDINAL]] recorded reference to [[Wrexham|the town|non_person_coref]] in [[1161|DATE]] is to a castle at 'Wristlesham'.

Stability under the princes of [[Powys Fadog|Powys Fadog|annotation]] enabled [[Wrexham|Wrexham|alias_match_article_entity]] to develop as a trading town and administrative centre of [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[two|NUMBER]] commotes making up the [[Lordship|LOCATION]].

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" offers backward compatibility with content and hardware from previous versions of "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" within the same console family; wireless guitar and drum controllers from [[PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3|annotation]] and [[Xbox 360|Xbox 360|annotation]] versions of "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" can be used on the [[PlayStation 4|PS4|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]] versions (with [[PlayStation 4|PS4|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] using an existing USB dongle, and [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]] requiring a newly produced USB dongle), and [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] songs purchased on prior installments on [[PlayStation 3|PS3|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and [[Xbox 360|Xbox 360|alias_match_match_candidate]] can be re-downloaded at no extra charge on [[PlayStation 4|PS4|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]] in a ported form that supports [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s features.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] plans to release free and paid [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] that will add new features and content to [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] over time, in lieu of releasing yearly installments; this includes the addition of support for synchronous online play added on [[January 25, 2017|DATE]].

Critical reception to "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" on-launch was positive, with reviews praising [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] for not significantly deviating from [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]play mechanics of prior installments, as well as the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with previously-released content for the "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" franchise.

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] was also criticized for lacking features [[present|DATE]] in previous versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes.

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]play of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" follows that from previous games in the series: the player or group of players use special instrument-based controllers or microphones to mimic playing the instruments by following scrolling cues on screen and attempt to play through a song and score points.

At "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" release, [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] supported [[three|NUMBER]] main modes.

broad classifications such as by genre type, release [[year|DURATION]], or song length. To aid in the cooperative nature of [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]], any scoring multipliers and remaining Overdrive are carried over between songs in Gig lists as well as between sets in the Career mode.

The main mode for "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" is a Band Tour career mode which [[IGN|IGN|annotation]] described as a role-playing game.

While there are a number of possible sets that the band can select from with more unlocked as the players progresses in [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]], the primary means of advancing the band's narrative is through multi-part Tours which consist of [[3|NUMBER]] to [[6|NUMBER]] different shows to be played in order.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" [[now|DATE]] has the use of Freestyle Guitar Solos, an optional feature.

sections, with an added scoring bonus based on the percentage of the solo notes hit correctly. When this feature is enabled, instead of the predefined solo, [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] shows suggestions for the solo style to emulate at that time, such as single notes or longer licks, c

h section of the solo. [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] includes tutorials to help explain these mechanics to players. Further, the audio feedback from these solos has been refined as to make whatever the player performs stay consistent and in-tune with the other active and backing instruments.

Drums players for "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" are able to count down to start the song as often done by real-life bands.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" will change how the drummer can trigger overdrive: unlike [[past|DATE]] titles, where the drummer would gain a free-form section and then strike a specific pad to activate overdrive, which [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] found would throw some players off, "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" presents [[one|NUMBER]] of a random number of pre-created drum fills that fit the timing of the song when the drummer player has Overdrive available.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" ships with more pre-made characters to allow players to get into [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] faster, and atop more options from previous games, removes restrictions on gender-fixed items; for example, mustaches and beards were only an option for male characters in previous games.

In an interview with "[[Vice (magazine)|Vice|annotation]]" in [[June 2015|DATE]], [[Sussman|PERSON]] stated that [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] would not ship with support for online play, as surveys taken prior to release, and their own tracking, showed that only about [[10%|PERCENT]] of previous "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" players used the online feature, and thus focused on building out the local play features [[first|ORDINAL]] for release.

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] at launch did support online leaderboards and score tracking at launch, and has added additional asynchronous features since.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" is designed by [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a platform title

tes are anticipated to include bug fixes and new gameplay features to the base game. Many of the updates are based on feedback from players about [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]].

Playlists were added as part of [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s [[April 2016|DATE]] update, and a practice mode and enhanced sort sorting were added with the [[June 2016|DATE]] update.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] released a patch to include online play on [[January 25, 2017|DATE]], an oft-requested feature since "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]"s launch; this will require players to have purchased the "Rivals" expansion (described below).

Sussman has asserted that they do not plan to bring back keyboard support that had been in "[[Rock Band 3|Rock Band 3|alias_match_match_candidate]]", seeing it diverge from their [[current|DATE]] target for "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

In addition to free updates to [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]], [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] has planned to release purchasable expansions to "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]", adopting a model similar to such paid expansions on "[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny|annotation]]" and "[[World of Warcraft|World of Warcraft|annotation]]".

The [[first|ORDINAL]] paid expansion, "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band Rivals|alias_match_article_entity]]", was released on [[October 18, 2016|DATE]].

Players gain Fame by earning stars in these sets, which are needed to progress further in the [[Rockudrama|LOCATION]], and by achieving a specific amount of fame over several sets, the player can unlock new venues that will appear in other gameplay areas of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band Rivals|alias_match_article_entity]]" itself did not include additional songs at launch, although those who pre-ordered the expansion received up to [[twelve|NUMBER]] new songs for free; these songs were later released for sale to other users.

The new server architecture of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" allowed [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] to update and add Missions over time without having to patch [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]].

Development of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" began in [[the last quarter of 2014|DATE]].

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s former CEO and [[current|DATE]] creative director [[Alex Rigopulos|Alex Rigopulos|annotation]] explained that the studio had awaited both a "critical mass" of adoption for the next-generation consoles, and a "clear and compelling creative vision" for [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] before beginning work on a successor—prompting the franchise's hiatus.

[[Alex Rigopulos|Rigopulos|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] said that internally if they were going to bring back "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]", they wanted to "really make the best game that we had ever made; that we had a vision for what [[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]] was going to be, that made it worth making, really".

A clear vision of the goals for [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] came [[about more than a year|DURATION]] prior to [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s release.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[Greg LoPiccolo|PERSON]] added that they did not want to try to introduce "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" during the new consoles' [[first year|DATE]] where they would have to compete with major franchises.

Funding for development was aided by [[$15 million|MONEY]] in investments from [[Spark Capital|Spark Capital|annotation]] and [[Foundry Group|ORGANIZATION]], not only to support "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" but the remake of [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]]' "[[Amplitude (2003 video game)|Amplitude|annotation]]" and [[future|DATE]] projects involving virtual reality.

Following the aggressive focus on musical instruction within "[[Rock Band 3|Rock Band 3|alias_match_match_candidate]]", "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" instead puts a larger focus on the franchise's core gameplay, multiplayer, and the overall feeling of the experience; [[Alex Rigopulos|Rigopulos|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] felt that the franchise had become too "sprawling" in functionality, and that "there is an existing gameplay core that is very powerful and very fun, and we don't want to tamper with that core.

Owing to this renewed focus, the Pro Guitar and piano keyboard modes were dropped from [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]].

The new Freestyle Guitar Solo feature was something that [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] had built a prototype for in [[early 2014|DATE]]; at the [[time|DATE]] they did not have a clear concept of its use but found the mechanic to have potential and built up parts of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" around it.

Rigopulos also noted that they were not trying to develop "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" with competition from "[[Guitar Hero Live|Guitar Hero Live|annotation]]" in mind; that competition had caused the original over-saturation of the rhythm game market in [[2009|DATE]].

With "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]", [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]]' goal is a smaller but known fraction of the market of both old "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" players and new ones, such that meeting those numbers would make [[Guitar Hero Live|the game|non_person_coref]] financially viable even if it does not outsell "[[Guitar Hero Live|Guitar Hero Live|alias_match_match_candidate]]".

On [[March 5, 2015|DATE]], [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] officially announced "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" is expected to be the only retail release of the franchise for the [[current|DATE]] generation of consoles; [[Alex Rigopulos|Rigopulos|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] called the multiple-release cycle "taxing" on both the studio and consumers, and instead sees [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] as a platform which they can continuously improve over the life of the title without excessive work.

In [[August 2015|DATE]], [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] stated that they already have plans for post-release patches, both free and paid, to add new gameplay functionality to expand the "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" title, with plans to release a free patch in [[December 2015|DATE]] to include an option for "Variable Breakneck Speed", which affects the rate at which notes scroll on the screen, among other features.

In [[March 2016|DATE]], [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] launched a crowd funding campaign through the [[Fig (company)|Fig|annotation]] platform to produce "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" for personal computers, to have been released in [[the last quarter of 2016|DATE]].

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] estimated [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] would cost [[$2 million|MONEY]] to make, of which they would contribute [[$500,000|MONEY]] towards if they can raise the remaining [[$1.5 million|MONEY]].

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] would have been released via [[Steam (service)|Steam|annotation]], allowing users to use the [[Steam (service)|Steam Workshop|alias_match_single_candidate]] to create their own songs and distribute it to others, with curation by [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] to avoid copyright infringements, in a manner comparable to the [[Rock Band Network|Rock Band Network|annotation]] but at a lower cost; they have already ported the previous [[Rock Band Network|Rock Band Network|alias_match_match_candidate]] tools to offer to backers of the campaign.

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] would have shipped with the same [[65|NUMBER]] songs as the console version, and at least [[1700|DATE]] songs for downloadable content (all those [[currently|DATE]] available for "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" on consoles), though, as with the console versions, users would have had to repurchase these songs on the [[Steam (service)|PC|alias_match_single_candidate]] and cannot transfer over songs they already own on either platform.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] has confirmed that with the backward compatibility of both the [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X and Series S|annotation]] and [[PlayStation 5|PlayStation 5|annotation]] consoles to be released in [[November 2020|DATE]], that "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" will be playable on the new consoles with most of the officially-supported instruments that worked on [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4|alias_match_match_candidate]], and that players will be able to bring over all downloadable content they had purchased to the new consoles.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] plans to continue to support [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] with further [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] after the new console's launch.

[[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]] developed updated guitar and drum controllers for "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]"; [[Harmonix|the company|non_person_coref]] noted that while it did not want to "reinvent the wheel", the controllers still featured technical improvements, such as reduced wireless latency and a more sensitive tilt sensor on the guitar.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] stated that it had "aggressively" worked with console manufacturers on means to allow guitar and drum controllers from the [[PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3|annotation]] and [[Xbox 360|Xbox 360|annotation]] versions of "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" to be forward compatible with "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]"; [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]] both agreed that while technically difficult to complete, this compatibility was necessary to support the "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" community.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" on [[PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4|alias_match_match_candidate]] natively supports [[PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3|alias_match_match_candidate]] "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" instruments by means of the [[USB|USB|annotation]] dongle that they require to operate.

On [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]], standalone copies of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" are bundled with a "Legacy Adapter" to allow use of wireless [[Xbox 360|Xbox 360|alias_match_match_candidate]] instrument controllers, including those developed to support "[[Guitar Hero|Guitar Hero|alias_match_match_candidate]]" games.

Due to the inclusion of this hardware, the retail price of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" on [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]] was higher than the [[PlayStation 4|PS4|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] version.

Existing [[USB|USB|alias_match_match_candidate]] microphones remain compatible with "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

. Owing to [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s focus on core gameplay, and concerns that consumers may be unwilling to buy additional hardware for specific games early in a console generation's lifecycle, "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" did not feature additional accessories. At retail, [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] is available in a band bundle, with a guitar, drum, and microphone, and a guitar-only bundle.

In [[March 2016|DATE]], [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] announced that [[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]] would be replaced by [[Performance Designed Products|Performance Designed Products|acronym_entity]] ([[Performance Designed Products|PDP|acronym]]) as "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]"s publisher and hardware partner later in [[the year|DATE]], with updated hardware to be released at that time to coincide with the upcoming "Rivals" expansion for [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]].

During [[E3 2016|E3 2016|annotation]], [[Performance Designed Products|PDP|acronym_ner]] and [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] unveiled new hardware that was released alongside the "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band Rivals|alias_match_article_entity]]" expansion.

A new full band bundle featuring "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" and the "Rivals" expansion, a [[Fender Jaguar|Jaguar|alias_match_single_candidate]] guitar and a drumkit shipped alongside the digital release of the "Rivals" expansion in [[late 2016|DATE]].

With the PDP-supplied instruments, [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] will be able to offer the instrument-and-game bundles at lower cost than on [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s initial release; for example, [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] and guitar bundle on release initially had a MSRP of [[$120|MONEY]], but the new bundle will be priced at [[$90|MONEY]].

While part of this reduction in cost is attributed to the age of [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]], [[Sussman|PERSON]] stated that several factors relating to [[Performance Designed Products|PDP|acronym_ner]]'s manufacturing and business models allows them to offer the packages at a more competitive price point.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" ships with [[65|NUMBER]] songs on disc, spanning from [[the 1960s|DATE]] to [[the 2010s|DATE]].

The studio also worked to ensure that as much of its existing library of downloadable songs would be compatible with [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] upon its release as possible; [[1,500|NUMBER]] songs were available at launch.

Nearly all existing official "[[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] is compatible with "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" within the same console family (i.e. [[PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4|alias_match_match_candidate]] can only import songs purchased on [[PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3|alias_match_match_candidate]], and [[Xbox One|Xbox One|alias_match_match_candidate]] can only import songs purchased on [[Xbox 360|Xbox 360|alias_match_match_candidate]]).

Previous disc exports from the previous disc-based games in [[Guitar Hero|the series|non_person_coref]] (excluding "[[The Beatles: Rock Band|The Beatles: Rock Band|annotation]]"), the Track Packs, and from "[[Rock Band Blitz|Rock Band Blitz|annotation]]" will eventually be available for players, as long as they have [[previously|DATE]] performed the disc export; there will be no option to export these songs into "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

"[[Rock Band 3|Rock Band 3|alias_match_match_candidate]]" on-disc songs are expected to be exportable into "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" in [[December 2015|DATE]].

"If you bought a [[Rock Band|Rock Band|alias_match_match_candidate]] song, it should be yours in "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]"," said [[Sussman|PERSON]].

Following transition of all official [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]], [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] announced in [[May 2018|DATE]] it will also start bringing the most popular and fan-requested entries from the [[Rock Band Network|Rock Band Network|annotation]] into "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

In most cases, existing songs will be updated to use both Freestyle Guitar and Vocals within "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]".

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] has resumed releasing [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] since the release of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]", generally releasing [[three|NUMBER]] to [[six|NUMBER]] new songs [[each week|SET]], with [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] not being released during [[the weeks|DURATION]] that a new patch is introduced.

"[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" received positive reviews from critics, who judged that [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] does not significantly deviate from its [[past|DATE]], otherwise strong, iterations, but considered the soundtrack to be weaker than previous games.

"[[IGN|IGN|alias_match_match_candidate]]" praised "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" for remaining "every bit the magical cooperative gaming experience [[Guitar Hero|the series|non_person_coref]] has always been", with a particular focus on its continuity in gameplay with previous installments, and its "party-friendly" improvements to managing multiplayer play.

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s on-disc soundtrack was considered "weaker" than previous installments, describing it as primarily featuring "B-list" musicians, lesser-known songs by notable acts (such as [[Rush (band)|Rush|annotation]]) that had not yet been featured i

[[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s backward compatibility with songs purchased for previous versions provided a "massive incentive" for players with pre-existing libraries. The Tour mode was praised for its unpredictability and humor, although noting that it was more fun with a larger library of songs beyond those included with [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]].

Although praising "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" for maintaining the "spirit" of prior installments, it was panned for not distinguishing itself enough from them, such as describing the career mode as being an iteration of a structure already used in previous music games (including "[[Rock Band 2|Rock Band 2|annotation]]").

[[The NPD Group|NPD Group|annotation]] reported that "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" was the [[tenth|ORDINAL]] best selling game for [[October 2015|DATE]] based on units, while accounting for price, was the [[fourth|ORDINAL]] best selling game.

Analyst [[Michael Pachter|Michael Pachter|annotation]] estimated revenue from "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" sales were about [[$100 million|MONEY]] in [[early 2016|DATE]].

[[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]], prior to release, had anticipated high sales of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" in part to avoid defaulting to their [[current|DATE]] debtor; however, sales were lower than expected based on their [[2016|DATE]] Fiscal [[Year|DURATION]] results.

Though "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" contributed significantly towards sales of controller hardware for [[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Harmonix|the company|non_person_coref]] found [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s "sell-through was lower than originally forecast resulting in higher inventory balances as well as lower margins due to increased promotional activity with retailers".

In their financial earnings report given mid-2016, [[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]] reported a total loss of more than [[$11 million|MONEY]], much of it attributed to unsold "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" inventory.

[[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] subsequently announced in [[March 2016|DATE]] that [[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]] would be replaced by [[Performance Designed Products|PDP|acronym_ner]] as [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s publishing and hardware partner.

In [[Mad Catz|Mad Catz|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[2016|DATE]] annual financial report, [[Harmonix|the company|non_person_coref]] said that its partnership with [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]] for "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" had been a "burden" on [[Harmonix|the company|non_person_coref]], as though they ultimately sold all stock of their instruments, the revenues were not as great as anticipated.

Shortly following [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s release, it was discovered that some of [[Harmonix|Harmonix|alias_match_match_candidate]]' employees has submitted very positive customers reviews as anonymous users for [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]] at [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com|annotation]].

Separately, [[PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4|alias_match_match_candidate]] users of "[[Rock Band 4|Rock Band 4|alias_match_article_entity]]" in [[Europe|Europe|LOCATION_popular_entity]] were unable to download some of their [[previously|DATE]] purchased [[DLC|ORGANIZATION]] from the PlayStation Store, [[at least four weeks|DURATION]] after [[Rock Band 4|the game|non_person_coref]]'s launch.





Strikebreaker (short story)

"[[Strikebreaker (short story)|Strikebreaker|annotation]]" is a science fiction short story by American writer [[Isaac Asimov|Isaac Asimov|annotation]].

It was [[first|ORDINAL]] published in the [[January 1957|DATE]] issue of "[[Future Science Fiction and Science Fiction Stories|The Original Science Fiction Stories|annotation]]" under the title "[[Strikebreaker (short story)|Male Strikebreaker|alias_match_article_entity]]" and reprinted in the [[1969|DATE]] collection "[[Nightfall and Other Stories|Nightfall and Other Stories|annotation]]" under the original title "[[Strikebreaker (short story)|Strikebreaker|alias_match_article_entity]]".

[[Isaac Asimov|Asimov|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] has stated the editorial decision to run the story as "[[Strikebreaker (short story)|Male Strikebreaker|alias_match_article_entity]]" "represents my personal record for stupid title changes".

"[[Strikebreaker (short story)|Strikebreaker|alias_match_article_entity]]" had its genesis in [[June 1956|DATE]] when [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], who then lived in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts|annotation]], was planning a trip to [[New York City|New York City|annotation]].

The world of [[Strikebreaker (short story)|Elsevere|alias_match_article_entity]] is an extrasolar planetoid a [[hundred|NUMBER]] miles in diameter.

A visiting Earth sociologist, [[Strikebreaker (short story)|Steven Lamorak|alias_match_article_entity]], learns that [[Strikebreaker (short story)|Igor Ragusnik|alias_match_article_entity]] has gone on strike.

The [[Ragusnik|PERSON]] family operates [[Strikebreaker (short story)|Elsevere|alias_match_article_entity]]'s waste processing facility, and over the generations, the Ragusniks have become a one-family caste of untouchables, forbidden all contact with the rest of the colony.

[[Strikebreaker (short story)|Igor Ragusnik|alias_match_article_entity]] demands that [[Isaac Asimov|his|PERSON_coref]] family's isolation end.

New River (Mexico–United States)

The [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|annotation]] ([[New River (Mexico–United States)|Río Nuevo|alias_match_article_entity]]) flows north from near [[Cerro Prieto|PERSON]], through [[Mexicali|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Mexicali|Mexicali|annotation]], [[Baja California|Baja California|annotation]], [[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]], into the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]] through [[Calexico, California|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Calexico, California|Calexico, California|annotation]], towards the [[Salton Sea|Salton Sea|annotation]].

[[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] channel has existed since pre-historic times.

However, [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] as known [[today|DATE]] formed from a levee failure and massive flooding that re-created the [[Salton Sea|Salton Sea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Today|DATE]], [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] flow mostly consists of agricultural runoff, municipal discharge and industrial wastewater.

[[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] has been called the most severely polluted river of its size in the [[Uni

ted States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]]. Several projects have begun to reduce and mitigate the levels of pollution in [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]], including upgrades to sewage treatment infrastructure and enclosure of [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] channel.

The [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|annotation]] has issued a safe eating  for any fish caught in [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] due to elevated levels of mercury, [[DDT|DDT|annotation]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB|annotation]]s, and selenium.

The [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] channel begins at a volcanic lake near [[Cerro Prieto Geothermal Power Station|Cerro Prieto|PERSON_single_candidate]].

[[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] flows north [[15|NUMBER]] mi through [[Baja California|Baja California|alias_match_match_candidate]] and another [[66|NUMBER]] mi through [[California|California|LOCATION_popular_entity]] into the [[Salton Sea|Salton Sea|alias_match_match_candidate]], the largest lake in [[California|California|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]]'s flow is composed of agricultural and chemical runoff waste from farm industry irrigation in the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] ([[18.4%|PERCENT]]) and [[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]] ([[51.2%|PERCENT]]), sewage from [[Mexicali|Mexicali|annotation]] ([[29%|PERCENT]]), and manufacturing plants operating in [[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]] ([[1.4%|PERCENT]]).

Where [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] crosses the [[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]]–[[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] border near [[Calexico, California|Calexico, California|annotation]], its channel contains a stew of about a [[hundred|NUMBER]] contaminants: volatile organic compounds, heavy metals including selenium, uranium, arsenic and mercury, pesticides (including [[DDT|DDT|annotation]]), and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs|annotation]].

In [[2017|DATE]] monthly samples from the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] ranged from [[12,000|NUMBER]] to more than [[160,000|NUMBER]] per [[100|NUMBER]] milliliters.

Highly polluted inflow to the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] and agricultural runoff have resulted in elevated bacterial levels and large algal blooms in the [[Salton Sea|Salton Sea|alias_match_match_candidate]].

The modern courses of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] and the [[Alamo River|Alamo River|annotation]], and the creation of the [[Salton Sea|Salton Sea|annotation]], date from [[the autumn of 1904|DATE]] when heavy rainfall and snowmelt caused the swollen [[Colorado River|Colorado River|annotation]] to overrun a set of headgates for the [[Alamo Canal|Alamo Canal|annotation]].

The flood significantly enlarged the channels of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Alamo River|Alamo|alias_match_single_candidate]] Rivers.

Although thorough documentation of the pollution prior to [[1960|DATE]] is not available, records show the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] identified as a significant water pollution problem since the late [[1940s|DATE]].

The [[International Boundary and Water Commission|International Boundary and Water Commission|annotation]] ([[International Boundary and Water Commission|IBWC|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) was authorized by the [[two|NUMBER]] governments to study pollution of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] from [[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]].

Studies in [[1947|DATE]] and [[1948|DATE]] of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] led the [[International Boundary and Water Commission|IBWC|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] to recommend a joint treatment plant constructed in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]] to treat the sewage from [[Calexico, California|Calexico|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s relatively lax environmental regulations on manufacturing plants or "maquiladoras", allowed these plants to use the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] as an industrial waste drainage system.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] paid [[55%|PERCENT]] of a [[$50 million|MONEY]] upgrade to [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s sewage treatment facilities, but the improvements did not treat all waste discharges into [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]].

In [[2018|DATE]], construction began on a bollard portion of the [[Mexico–United States barrier|Mexico–United States barrier|annotation]] across [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]].

By [[2018|DATE]], most of [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] in [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]] was covered, but sometimes overflowed its covered riverbanks when it rained.

The stench of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] near the border is often overpowering, particularly at [[night|TIME]] and during the [[summer|DATE]] when temperatures can reach [[120|NUMBER]] °F.

The [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] is so heavily polluted that technicians usually wear [[two|NUMBER]] sets of gloves, aprons and other protective clothing when testing the water.

US [[Mexico–United States border|Border|alias_match_single_candidate]] Control agents have instructions to stay out of [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] except in emergencies.

d raw sewage was found to be in [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]]

In [[2006|DATE]], through another binational project, [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]] finished building [[a second|DURATION]] wastewater treatment facility to treat the [[10|NUMBER]] to [[20|NUMBER]] e6USgal per [[day|DURATION]] of raw and partially treated sewage that was being discharged into [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]].

In [[May 2005|DATE]], the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] was designated as [[one|NUMBER]] of [[two|NUMBER]] environmental justice water quality pilot projects for the [[United States Department of State|State|alias_match_single_candidate]] of [[California Environmental Protection Agency|California Environmental Protection Agency|annotation]] ([[California Environmental Protection Agency|CalEPA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) to try to address the various pollution sources collaboratively between the various stakeholders.

On [[July 25, 2005|DATE]], [[Governor of California|Governor of California|annotation]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Arnold Schwarzenegger|annotation]] signed [[California State Legislature|Senate Bill|annotation]] [[387|NUMBER]], introduced by [[California State Senate|Senator|annotation]] [[Denise Moreno Ducheny|Denise Moreno Ducheny|annotation]] (D-San Diego), which provided funding for the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] Improvement Project.

# Construction of green belts and recreational facilities in a restored [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] floodplain.

According to the [[Colorado River|Colorado River|alias_match_match_candidate]] Regional Water Quality Control Board, [[once|DATE]] the new wastewater treatment facility is fully operational, it will handle the [[10|NUMBER]] to [[20|NUMBER]] e6USgal per [[day|DURATION]] of raw sewage [[currently|DATE]] being discharged into the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]].

While this should result in measurable improved water quality of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] at the border, particularly as it relates to pathogens and nutrients, the binational projects do not address the dumping of trash into the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] and its tributaries, the nutrients and pathogens from [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s Zaragoza wastewater treatment lagoons, the untreated and partially treated discharges of industrial wastes, agricultural runoff from the [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]] Valley, and urban and storm runoff from the municipality.

[[Mexico|Mexico|alias_match_popular_entity]] intends to reclaim effluent from the treatment plant for onsite green belts, resulting in a [[20|NUMBER]] e6USgal per [[day|DURATION]] decrease in flow of the [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River|alias_match_article_entity]] at the border, in addition to the projected [[10|NUMBER]] e6USgal per [[day|DURATION]] decrease in flow in [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] at the border when the  and [[Sempra Energy|Sempra Energy|annotation]] power plants reach capacity in [[Mexicali|Mexicali|alias_match_match_candidate]].

According to the [[Imperial Irrigation District|Imperial Irrigation District|annotation]], although water pollution is a severe problem at the border, by the time [[New River (Mexico–United States)|the river|non_person_coref]] enters the [[Salton Sea|Salton Sea|alias_match_match_candidate]], the issue is "not significant"; water quality improves as the water makes its way north due to the addition of agricultural drain water and through natural cleansing occurring in the intervening [[60|NUMBER]] mi.





Kirikou and the Sorceress

"Kirikou and the Sorceress" ([[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou et la Sorcière|annotation]]) is a [[1998|DATE]] traditional animation feature film written and directed by [[Michel Ocelot|Michel Ocelot|annotation]].

Drawn from elements of [[West Africa|West Africa|annotation]]n folk tales, it depicts how a newborn boy, [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]], saves [[Michel Ocelot|his|PERSON_coref]] village from the evil witch Karaba.

It was so successful that it was followed by "[[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] et les bêtes sauvages", released in [[2005|DATE]], and adapted into a stage musical, "[[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou et Karaba|alias_match_article_entity]]", [[first|ORDINAL]] performed in [[2007|DATE]].

Another followup, "[[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] et les hommes et les femmes", was released in [[late 2012|DATE]].

In a little [[West Africa|West Africa|annotation]]n village, a precocious little boy named [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] is born in an unusual way.

After [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]]'s mother tells [[Michel Ocelot|him|PERSON_coref]] that an evil sorceress, [[Karaba|Karaba|PERSON_geo_disambiguation]], has dried up their [[spring|DATE]] and devoured all the males of the village except for [[one|NUMBER]], [[Michel Ocelot|he|PERSON_coref]] decides to accompany the last warrior, [[Michel Ocelot|his|PERSON_coref]] uncle, to visit [[her|PERSON]].

[[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] manages to trick the sorceress and save [[Michel Ocelot|his|PERSON_coref]] uncle by waiting inside [[Michel Ocelot|his|PERSON_coref]] uncle's hat and pretending that it's magic.

Additionally, [[Michel Ocelot|he|PERSON_coref]] saves the village's children from being kidnapped both by the sorceress's boat and tree, and bursts the monster who was drinking all the village's water, gaining trust and stature in the eyes of the villagers who were at [[first|ORDINAL]] skeptical of [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]].

With the help of [[Michel Ocelot|his|PERSON_coref]] mother and various animals, [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] then evades [[Karaba|Karaba|PERSON_geo_disambiguation]]'s watchman to travel into the forbidden mountain to ask [[Michel Ocelot|his|PERSON_coref]] wise old grandfather about the sorceress, who tells [[Michel Ocelot|him|PERSON_coref]] that [[she|PERSON]] is evil because [[she|PERSON]] suffers from a poisoned thorn in [[her|PERSON]] back, which causes [[her|PERSON]] great pain and also gives [[her|PERSON]] great power.

After learning this, [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] manages to take the sorceress's stolen gold, thus luring [[her|PERSON]] outside to where [[Michel Ocelot|he|PERSON_coref]] can trick [[her|PERSON]] and extract the poisoned thorn.

As a result, the sorceress is cured of [[her|PERSON]] suffering, and [[she|PERSON]] kisses [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]], who then becomes an adult.

When [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Karaba|Karaba|PERSON_geo_disambiguation]] arrive back at the village, no [[one|NUMBER]] believes that the sorceress is cured until a procession of drummers arrive with [[Kirikou and the Sorceress|Kirikou|alias_match_article_entity]]'s grandfather.

TransGeneration

That [[year|DURATION]], "[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]]" won the [[GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary|GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary|annotation]], and was a nominee for the [[IDA Documentary Award|ORGANIZATION]] in the Limited Series category

. [[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] response to [[TransGeneration|the show|non_person_coref]] from critics and other viewers ranged from exuberant to dismissive. In addition, some viewers believed [[TransGeneration|the show|non_person_coref]] had distinct educational value, while others felt that the chosen narratives oversimplified the subject.

[[A year|DURATION]] after taping the series, [[World of Wonder (company)|World of Wonder|alias_match_single_candidate]] produced a half-hour reunion show, "[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]] Reunion".

"[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]]" introduces viewers to [[four|NUMBER]] transgender college students—[[two|NUMBER]] trans women and [[two|NUMBER]] trans men—who are each studying at a different college in the [[United States|United States|LOCATION_popular_entity]] during t

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] idea for "[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]]" came in [[2004|DATE]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_single_candidate]] companies planned for [[Sundance TV|Sundance|alias_match_single_candidate]] to air [[TransGeneration|the show|non_person_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]], followed by [[Logo TV|Logo|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[several months later|DATE]].

"[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]]" was produced at a time when the [[Sundance TV|Sundance Channel|alias_match_single_candidate]] was actively working to expand their library of original programming, to outsource production, and to foster a public image as a channel for independent thinking.

In a [[2005|DATE]] essay published in the online journal "Flow", [[Shana Agid|PERSON]], guest faculty at [[Sarah Lawrence College|Sarah Lawrence College|annotation]], wondered whether programs like "[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]]" "take away from other possibilities for change" if—in an effort to make queer subject matter "straight-friendly" and "consumable"—they only represent transgender people who fit a certain narrative and adhere to a gender binary.

K. [[Nicole Hladky|PERSON]] ([[2013|DATE]]) identifies [[four|NUMBER]] themes in the series: "process" (the various dimensions of transition); "intersection" (of transgender with race, class, age, nationality, etc.); "stigma" (borne by transgender people); and "prescription", in which the documentary perspective of "[[TransGeneration|TransGeneration|alias_match_article_entity]]" prefers or endorses "particular views of transgenderism and approaches to transition".

Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)

The [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|annotation]] ([[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Armée du Rhin|alias_match_article_entity]]) was formed in [[December 1791|DATE]], for the purpose of bringing the French Revolution to the German states along the [[Rhine|Rhine River|annotation]].

During its [[first year|DATE]] in action ([[1792|DATE]]), under command of [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Adam Philippe Custine|annotation]], the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] participated in several victories, including [[Siege of Mainz (1792)|Mainz|annotation]], [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and Speyer.

The [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] ("[[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Armée du Rhin|alias_match_article_entity]]") was [[one|NUMBER]] of the main [[French Revolutionary Army|French Revolutionary armies|annotation]] operated in the [[Rhineland|LOCATION]] theater, principally in the [[Rhine|Rhine River|annotation]] valley, from [[1791|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1795|DATE]].

At its creation, the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] had [[88,390|NUMBER]] men.

In [[October 1792|DATE]], a portion of [[Army of the North (France)|the army|non_person_coref]] was used to form the [[Army of the Vosges|Army of the Vosges|annotation]] but these units rejoined the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] on [[15 March 1793|DATE]].

Although much of the [[spring|DATE]] and [[summer of 1792|DATE]] action continued throughout in the border regions with [[Belgium|Belgium|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the cities along the Upper [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]], especially [[Strasbourg|the city|non_person_coref]] of [[Strasbourg|Strasbourg|annotation]], felt under threat of invasion by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] armies massing on the east side of the [[Rhine|Rhine River|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

That [[evening|TIME]], [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle|Rouget de Lisle|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] wrote "Chant de guerre pour l'[[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Armée du Rhin|alias_match_article_entity]]" (English: "War Song for the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]]"), and dedicated the song to Marshal [[Nicolas Luckner|Nicolas Luckner|annotation]], a [[Bavaria|Bavaria|annotation]]n in [[La Marseillaise|French|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] service.

The [[French Revolutionary Army|French|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] government ordered [[Nicolas Luckner|Luckner|alias_match_single_candidate]] to take command of the [[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], and [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine|alias_match_single_candidate]] replaced [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|him|PERSON_coref]] as overall commander of the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Spring 1793|DATE]].

Under [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|his|PERSON_coref]] experienced command, the [[French Revolutionary Army|Army|alias_match_single_candidate]] took several important positions on the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]], including at [[Speyer|LOCATION]], [[Mainz|Mainz|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Limburg|LOCATION]] and [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt|LOCATION_popular_entity]] (see chart of battles below).

The rest of the [[Army of the Moselle|Army of the Moselle|alias_match_match_candidate]] united with the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] on [[20 April|DATE]], to form the [[Army of the Rhine and Moselle|Army of the Rhine and Moselle|annotation]].

Stability of command of the [[Army of the Rhine (1791–1795)|Army of the Rhine|alias_match_article_entity]] reflected the overall chaos of the [[French Revolution|French Revolutionary|alias_match_popular_redirect]] governments, especially in [[the years 1791|DATE]]–[[1794|DATE]].

Traditional IRA

An author described the traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] in [[1982|DATE]] as "the biggest tax break in history".

The [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] is held at a custodian institution such as a bank or brokerage, and may be invested in anything that the custodian allows (for instance, a bank may allow certificates of deposit, and a brokerage may allow stocks and mutual funds).

Unlike the [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA|annotation]], the only criterion for being eligible to contribute to a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] is sufficient income to make the contribution.

However, the best provision of a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] - the tax-deductibility of contributions - has strict eligibility requirements based on income, filing status, and availability of other retirement plans (mandated by the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service|annotation]]).

The traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] also has more restrictions on withdrawals than a [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA|alias_match_match_candidate]].

With both types of [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]], transactions inside the account (including capital gains, dividends, and interest) incur no tax liability.

Annual traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] contributions are limited as follows:

* The primary benefit of any tax deferred savings plan, such as an [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]], is that the amount of money available to invest is larger than woul

* An [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] protects wealth from creditors, but also cannot be used as collateral when borrowing.

* With a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]], [[one|NUMBER]] always has an option to convert to a [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA|alias_match_match_candidate]]; whereas a [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA|alias_match_match_candidate]] cannot be converted back into a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]].

As with options in finance, this flexibility, which allows [[one|NUMBER]] to hedge [[future|DATE]] uncertainty, adds some additional value to the traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]].

* All withdrawals from a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] are included in gross income, which are subject to federal income tax (with the exception of any nondeductible contributions; there is a formula for determining how much of a withdrawal is not subject to tax).

* The size of an [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] account may mislead people into believing their wealth is larger than it actually is.

This effect means that [[$xx|MONEY]] saved in a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] is not equal to [[$xx|MONEY]] saved in a [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Contributions to a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] are from pre-tax income and contributions to a [[Roth IRA|Roth|alias_match_single_candidate]] are from after-tax income.

Also, a taxpayer's [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] contributions cannot exceed that taxpayer's income in a given [[year|DURATION]].

For example, if a taxpayer make a total of [[$2000|MONEY]] in taxable compensation in a given [[year|DURATION]], then the maximum [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] contribution is [[$2000|MONEY]].

Note, income from investments may not be qualify as eligible for the purposes of [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] contributions.

All [[United States|United States|alias_match_match_candidate]] income taxpayers can make [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] contribution and defer [[Form 1040|the tax|non_person_coref]]ation on the earnings.

However, not all [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] contributions are deductible from a taxpayer's income tax.

Conversion of all or a part of a traditional [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] account to a [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA|annotation]] results in the converted funds being taxed as income in [[the year|DATE]] they are converted (with the exception of non-deductible assets).

Transfers and rollovers are [[two|NUMBER]] ways of moving [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] sheltered assets between financial institutions.

A rollover (sometimes referred to as a [[60-day|DURATION]] rollover) can also be used to move [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] money between institutions.

The participant would then have to make a rollover contribution to the receiving financial institution within [[60 days|DURATION]] in order for the funds to retain their [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] status.

[[Once|DATE]] the distribution is rolled into an [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]], the participant will be sent a Form [[5498|NUMBER]] to report on their taxes to nullify any tax consequence of the initial distribution.

A loan from an [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] is prohibited.

Some use the [[60-day|DURATION]] rollover as a way to temporarily take funds from an [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]].

A participant will take a distribution and, in turn, all or some of the distribution that the participant takes may be rolled back into the same [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]] plan within the allowed period to retain its tax deferred status.

[[One|NUMBER]] [[60-day|DURATION]] rollover is allowed every rolling [[12 months|DURATION]], per [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]].

However, this would not prevent you from making a tax-free rollover from another [[Traditional IRA|IRA|acronym_ner_part_of_seen_entity]].

Along with most of [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] comrades, [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] flew obsolescent [[Gloster Gladiator|Gloster Gladiator|annotation]] biplanes in support of the [[Australians|Australian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] 6th Division during the [[North African campaign|North African Campaign|annotation]]; [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] claimed no victories at this stage.

Promoted squadron leader, [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] took over [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]] from Wing Commander [[Ian Dougald McLachlan|Ian McLachlan|annotation]] on [[13 February 1941|DATE]], by which time the unit had converted to [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane|annotation]] monoplane fighters.

Based at [[Benina International Airport|RAF Benina|annotation]] in defence of [[Benghazi|Benghazi|annotation]] when [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] assumed command, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]] retreated eastwards only [[hours|DURATION]] ahead of German tanks after [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel|annotation]] launched [[Erwin Rommel|his|PERSON_coref]] offensive in [[April|DATE]].

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was flying a [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane|alias_match_single_candidate]] when [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] claimed [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] aerial victory on [[15 April 1941|DATE]].

Following a flight of [[four|NUMBER]] German [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52|annotation]] transports back to their base near [[Fort Capuzzo|Fort Capuzzo|annotation]], [[Libya|Libya|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] shot [[one|NUMBER]] down before it landed and strafed the other [[three|NUMBER]] on the ground, setting all on fire.

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] was decorated with the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross|annotation]] ([[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC|alias_match_single_candidate]]) for this exploit, as well as [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] "untiring efforts" and "high standard of efficiency ... under extremely trying conditions"; [[Distinguished Service Order|the award|non_person_coref]] was promulgated in the "[[The London Gazette|London Gazette|annotation]]" on [[13 May|DATE]].

[[Two days later|DATE]] [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] destroyed a [[Vichy France|Vichy French|annotation]] [[Martin Maryland|Martin 167|annotation]] bomber in southern [[Syria|Syria|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] was mentioned in despatches on [[24 September 1941|DATE]].

As commanding officer of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] came up with innovative ways of improving morale in the face of living conditions that were "primitive at best".

On [[one|NUMBER]] occasion [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] arranged accommodation for [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] men near a beach, well away from the din of night-time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis.

Another of [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] more "radical ideas" and lasting legacies was a combined mess for all pilots in the combat zone, whether commissioned or non-commissioned.

The concept was initially frowned upon by [[Royal Air Force|Royal Air Force|annotation]] units, but when [[Air Vice Marshal|ORGANIZATION]] "Mary" Coningham dined at the shared mess on [[11 October 1941|DATE]] and gave [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] approval, it took root across the entire [[Desert Air Force|Desert Air Force|annotation]]; leading ace [[Clive Caldwell|Clive Caldwell|annotation]] later put the same idea into practice as commander of the [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]'s [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No. 1 (Fighter) Wing|annotation]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin|annotation]], [[Northern Territory|Northern Territory|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[One|NUMBER]] of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s flight sergeants recalled that [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship, and also gave [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] senior warrant officers special responsibility for keeping track of the location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency.

Having been promoted to temporary wing commander and appointed wing leader of No. 234 Wing [[Royal Air Force|RAF|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] earlier in [[the month|DATE]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was credited with a share in the destruction of a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Messerschmitt Bf 110|annotation]] heavy fighter on [[20 November|DATE]].

[[Two days later|DATE]] [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] was shot down himself, but was uninjured and managed to make [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] way back to base.

On [[25 November|DATE]], above cheering Allied soldiers besieged in Tobruk, [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] led [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No. 112 Squadron RAF|annotation]] in an attack on [[Axis powers|Axis|annotation]] bombers that resulted in [[seven|NUMBER]] enemy aircraft being destroyed and [[eight|NUMBER]] damaged, against [[one|NUMBER]] [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Tomahawk|alias_match_single_candidate]] lost.

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] scored [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] [[fifth|ORDINAL]] solo victory during the engagement, shooting down a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and damaged another.

On [[30 November|DATE]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] rescued [[one|NUMBER]] of [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] old comrades from [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]], Sergeant Pilot [[Allan Cameron|Allan Cameron|PERSON_human_disambiguation]], who had crash-landed behind enemy lines.

Nicknamed "Tiny", [[Cameron|PERSON]] had the bulkiest frame of any man in the unit, and after landing [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had to ditch [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] parachute to make room for [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] passenger in the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Tomahawk|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s cockpit.

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] nevertheless managed to take off and return to base, and [[Cameron|PERSON]] went on to survive the war and become an ace in the process.

For this and other achievements [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|Distinguished Service Order|annotation]] on [[12 December 1941|DATE]].

As well as [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] rescue of the downed pilot, the citation paid tribute to [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] "great success" as wing leader, [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] "fine fighting spirit" in returning to base after having been shot down himself, and to [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] "magnificent leadership, fearlessness and skill" that had "contributed in a large measure to the successes achieved".

At [[the end of the month|DATE]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was posted back to [[Australia|Australia|alias_match_popular_entity]] to serve in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific|annotation]].

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] was credited with a total of [[five|NUMBER]] aerial victories in the [[Middle East|Middle East|alias_match_popular_entity]], plus [[one|NUMBER]] shared and [[one|NUMBER]] damaged, though [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] was considered to be "conservative" in [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] scoring.

On [[4 March|DATE]] [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] became the inaugural commander of [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron|annotation]], operating newly delivered [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawks|annotation]].

Forming [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|the squadron|non_person_coref]] in [[Townsville|Townsville|annotation]], [[Queensland|Queensland|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was responsible for readying it for the defence of [[Port Moresby|Port Moresby|LOCATION_popular_entity]], which would become [[one|NUMBER]] of the crucial early battles in the [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea campaign|annotation]].

Although it included [[two|NUMBER]] other veterans of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]] in the [[Middle East|Middle East|alias_match_popular_entity]], Flight Lieutenants "Old John" Jackson and [[Peter Turnbull (RAAF officer)|Peter Turnbull|annotation]], most of the unit's pilots were untried, and [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] had only [[nine days|DURATION]] to instil in them basic principles of combat flying, gunnery and tactics.

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] handed over command to [[John Francis Jackson|Jackson|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] on [[19 March|DATE]], but assisted in ferrying the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Kittyhawks|alias_match_single_candidate]] to [[Moresby|DATE]] [[two days later|DATE]], only to be fired upon by nervous anti-aircraft gunners as [[John Francis Jackson|he|PERSON_coref]] came in to land with [[Peter Turnbull (RAAF officer)|Turnbull|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[two|NUMBER]] other pilots.

All [[four|NUMBER]] aircraft were damaged, and [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] came within inches of death as a bullet flew [[past|DATE]] [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] skull and into the headrest of [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|his|PERSON_coref]] seat.

By [[24 March|DATE]], [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No. 75 Squadron|alias_match_single_candidate]] had already shot down several Japanese raiders; having witnessed it "quickly established as a fighting unit", [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] returned to [[Australia|Australia|alias_match_popular_entity]].

[[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|He|PERSON_coref]] immediately began working up [[a second|DURATION]] new [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Kittyhawk|alias_match_single_candidate]] unit for service in [[New Guinea|New Guinea|alias_match_popular_entity]], [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No. 76 (Fighter) Squadron|annotation]].

Later [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|he|PERSON_coref]] discussed the mission with [[Clive Caldwell|Caldwell|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], who was then commanding [[No. 80 Wing RAAF|No. 80 (Fighter) Wing|annotation]] and had tagged along to determine if such long-range operations might be worthwhile for [[Clive Caldwell|his|PERSON_coref]] squadrons.

[[The following month|DATE]], [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Jeffrey|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was recommended to be mentioned in despatches for "gallant and distinguished service" in [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area|alias_match_single_candidate]]; [[Distinguished Service Order|the award|non_person_coref]] was gazetted on [[9 March 1945|DATE]].

NewSat

[[NewSat|NewSat|annotation]] was an independent satellite communications provider in [[Australia|Australia|annotation]].

[[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] was founded on [[28 March 1987|DATE]], then named as [[Yalfaga|ORGANIZATION]].

In [[1999|DATE]] the company was purchased by [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]]'s CEO [[Adrian Ballintine|PERSON]] and renamed MultiEmedia.com (later just MultiEmedia).

It survived the dotcom crash, and with the purchase of [[New Skies Networks|ORGANIZATION]] and its teleport facilities in [[Adelaide|Adelaide|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[Perth|Perth|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[2005|DATE]], it evolved into a fully-fledged satellite communications company, changing its name to [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] on [[1 September 2006|DATE]].

Most of [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]]'s customers were located in [[Australia|Australia|alias_match_match_candidate]], the [[Middle East|Middle East|annotation]] and [[Africa|Africa|annotation]].

With the withdrawal of combat troops in [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and with the [[Australians|Australian|alias_match_popular_redirect]] mining boom winding down, the services for [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]]'s teleport business started to wane.

Having made a [[$39.7 million|MONEY]] loss in [[the second half of 2014|DATE]], and with [[$300 million|MONEY]] in outstanding loan repayments, [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] was placed in administration in [[mid April 2015|DATE]],.

With Jabiru, [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] was to be [[Australia|Australia|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[first|ORDINAL]] independently owned satellite operator to manage a fleet of commercial [[Ku band|Ku-|annotation]] and Ka-band satellites.

On [[8 December 2011|DATE]], [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] and [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] entered into a fixed price contract for the design, manufacture, testing and on‐ground delivery of Jabiru‐1, and its related launch mission operations.

On [[14 June 2012|DATE]], the [[Export–Import Bank of the United States|Export–Import Bank of the United States|annotation]] approved a direct loan of [[US$281 million|MONEY]] (later increased [[US$300.5 million|MONEY]]) to [[Jabiru Satellite Limited|ORGANIZATION]] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]]), with a guarantee by [[Compagnie Française d'Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur|Compagnie Française d'Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur|annotation]] ([[Compagnie Française d'Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur|COFACE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) and a stand-by facility from the British [[Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Bank|annotation]].

In [[mid February 2014|DATE]] with construction underway of the Jabiru-1 satellite, [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] had paid [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] close to [[US$170 million|MONEY]], out of an expected total cost of [[US$268 million|MONEY]].

At that time, [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] confirmed that [[18%|PERCENT]] capacity of the satellite had already been sold, at an estimated value of [[Australia|AU|alias_match_single_candidate]]$[[644 million|NUMBER]].

In [[early August 2014|DATE]], [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] got a conditional waiver over alleged breaches of financial facilities, to continue with the Jabiru-1 project.

On [[16 December 2014|DATE]], [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin|annotation]], the Jabiru-1 satellite builder, issued [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] a default notice due to a defaulted payment of [[US$21 million|MONEY]] ([[A$26.5 million|MONEY]]); giving a period of [[up to 90 days|DURATION]] to make payments without further impact.

In [[late March 2015|DATE]], [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] requested a trading halt due to ongoing issues with project financing, which would remain in place until negotiations with [[United States|US|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] lenders were completed.

On [[8 April 2015|DATE]] [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] announced that "[[Compagnie Française d'Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur|COFACE|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Lender Group" would not support the waiver and not advance funds.

In [[mid-April|DATE]] [[2015|DATE]], [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] was placed into administration to resolve the troubled financial situation and save the project; at the same time a temporary order was issued in the [[United States|US|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] to keep the construction contracts with [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Arianespace|Arianespace|ORGANIZATION_match_candidate]].

In [[August 2016|DATE]], it was revealed on the [[current|DATE]] affairs program [[Four|NUMBER]] Corners that [[NewSat|NewSat|alias_match_article_entity]] had been the victim of foreign hackers.

Oldsmobile Firenza

The [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Oldsmobile Firenza|annotation]] was a compact car which was produced by [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile|annotation]] from [[1982|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1988|DATE]].

The all-new [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] was introduced in [[March 1982|DATE]], as a replacement for the departed rear-wheel drive [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire|annotation]].

The [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] was positioned as [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s entry-level compact car, priced below the sightly larger [[Oldsmobile Omega|Omega|annotation]] and later [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Calais/Cutlass Calais|annotation]].

Despite this, the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] could be equipped with premium options such as power windows, power locks, and 14-inch alloy wheels.

Although closely related to its [[GM J platform|J-body|alias_match_single_candidate]] siblings, the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Oldsmobile Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] was badge engineered with distinctively [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile|alias_match_match_candidate]] front and rear end styling found on larger Oldsmobiles of the time.

The [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] was launched with a 2.0-liter OHV inline four-cylinder engine as the sole powerplant, but an overhead-cam 1.8-liter engine was added during the model [[year|DURATION]].

The [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] ES (EuroSport) sedan [[1984|DATE]] (maybe [[1985|DATE]]?)

For the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]]'s last model [[year, 1988|DATE]], it received a new open grille, aerodynamic composite headlamps, and tail lights, styled after those of the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Cutlass Ciera|annotation]].

Also for the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]]'s final [[year|DURATION]], the hatchback was dropped along with the V6, leaving just the four-cylinder notchback coupe, sedan, and wagon models.

All [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] bodystyles came in a single unnamed base model that could be equipped with [[six|NUMBER]] various option packages.

The [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] was never a strong seller for [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Sales of the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] were also hampered by [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile|alias_match_match_candidate]] management who fought hard not to have to sell the [[GM J platform|J-body|alias_match_single_candidate]] cars but had to, in order to keep the division’s [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] average fuel economy ratings up to meet [[General Motors|General Motors|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]]’ corporate standards and in compliance with Federal [[Corporate average fuel economy|CAFE|annotation]] regulations.

Also to blame was competition from the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]]’s rebadged [[GM J platform|J-body|alias_match_single_candidate]] siblings.

Sales of the [[Cavalier|Cavalier|alias_match_popular_entity]] and [[Pontiac Sunbird|Sunbird|alias_match_single_candidate]] annually dwarfed the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]], as they better fit into [[Chevrolet|Chevrolet|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]] and [[Pontiac Sunbird|Pontiac|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s value-oriented brand portfolios.

Due to this, the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] was not replaced in [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s lineup, leaving the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais|annotation]] as the division's smallest car.

[[Leeds Assembly|Leeds Assembly|annotation]], which built the [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]], was closed.

The last [[Oldsmobile Firenza|Firenza|alias_match_article_entity]] rolled off the assembly line on [[July 8, 1988|DATE]].





Woman of the Apocalypse

The [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Woman of the Apocalypse|annotation]] (or [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Woman clothed in the Sun|annotation]], γυνὴ περιβεβλημένη τὸν ἥλιον; "[[Woman of the Apocalypse|Mulier amicta sole|alias_match_article_entity]]") is a figure described in [[Revelation 12|Chapter 12|annotation]] of the [[Book of Revelation|Book of Revelation|annotation]] (written c. AD [[95|NUMBER]]).

[[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] gives birth to a male child who is threatened by a dragon, identified as the [[Devil|Devil|annotation]] and [[Satan|Satan|annotation]], who intends to devour the child as soon as [[he|PERSON]] is born.

When the child is taken to heaven, [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] flees into the wilderness leading to a "[[War in Heaven|War in Heaven|annotation]]" in which the angels cast out the dragon.

The dragon attacks [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]], who is given wings to escape and then attacks [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] again with a flood of water from [[his|PERSON]] mouth, which is subsequently swallowed by the earth.

Frustrated, the dragon initiates war on "the remnant of [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] seed", identified as the righteous followers of Christ.

The [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Woman of the Apocalypse|alias_match_article_entity]] is widely identified as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary|annotation]].

This view does not negate the alternative interpretation of [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] representing the [[Christian Church|Church|annotation]], as in [[Catholic Church|Catholic|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] teaching, [[Theotokos|Mary|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] is both the [[Theotokos|Mother of God|annotation]] and the [[Mother of the Church|Mother of the Church|annotation]].

Some [[Catholic Church|Catholic|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] commentaries, such as [[Thomas Haydock|Thomas Haydock|annotation]]'s [[Catholic Church|Catholic|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Bible Commentary ([[1859|DATE]]), allow for the interpretation of [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] as either the [[Catholic Church|Church|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] or [[Theotokos|Mary|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]].

The commentary of the [[New American Bible|New American Bible|annotation]] (the official [[Catholic Bible|Catholic Bible|annotation]] for [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]]) states that "[[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] adorned with the sun, the moon, and the stars (images taken from Genesis [[37:9|NUMBER]]–[[10|NUMBER]]) symbolizes God’s people in the Old and the New Testament.

In [[Protestantism|Protestant|annotation]] churches, including [[Calvinism|Reformed Churches|annotation]] and the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Movement|annotation]], the [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Woman of the Apocalypse|alias_match_article_entity]] tends to be seen as the [[Catholic Church|Church|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] or [[Israel|Israel|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The text describes "a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] feet, and upon [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] head a crown of [[twelve|NUMBER]] stars" ([[12:1|NUMBER]]).

[[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] is pregnant and about to give birth, "travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered" ([[12:2|NUMBER]]).

Then there is "a great red dragon, having [[seven|NUMBER]] heads and [[ten|NUMBER]] horns, and [[seven|NUMBER]] crowns upon [[Thomas Haydock|his|PERSON_coref]] heads" ([[12:3|NUMBER]]) who is about to "devour [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] child as soon as it was born" ([[12:4|NUMBER]]).

But [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] child is "caught up unto God" ([[12:5|NUMBER]]), and [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] herself is "fled into the wilderness, where [[Woman of the Apocalypse|she|PERSON_coref]] hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] there a [[thousand two hundred|DATE]] and threescore [[days|DURATION]]."

[[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] is again mentioned in [[12:13|LOCATION]], as [[Woman of the Apocalypse|she|PERSON_coref]] is persecuted by the dragon, and "[[two|NUMBER]] wings of a great eagle" are given to [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] to escape ([[12:14|TIME]]).

The dragon attacks [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] by "water as a flood" emerging from [[Thomas Haydock|his|PERSON_coref]] mouth ([[12:15|TIME]]), but the flood is swallowed up by the earth ([[12:16|TIME]]), so the dragon went "to make war with the remnant of [[Woman of the Apocalypse|her|PERSON_coref]] seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ" ([[12:17|TIME]]).

[[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]]'s "male child" is a reference to [[Jesus|Jesus|annotation]] ([[Revelation 12|Revelation 12|alias_match_match_candidate]]:5), since [[Jesus|he|PERSON_coref]] is destined to "rule all nations with a rod of iron" ([[Revelation 12|Revelation 12|alias_match_match_candidate]]:5).

The dragon trying to devour [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]]'s child at the moment of [[Jesus|his|PERSON_coref]] birth ([[Revelation 12|Revelation 12|alias_match_match_candidate]]:4) is a reference to [[Herod the Great|Herod the Great|annotation]]'s attempt to kill the infant [[Jesus|Jesus|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[Matthew 2:16|ORGANIZATION]]).

And [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II|annotation]] ([[1987|DATE]]) to the [[Protevangelium|Protoevangelium|annotation]] interpretation of [[Protevangelium|Genesis 3:15|alias_match_single_candidate]], and by extension the symbolic identification of [[Woman of the Apocalypse|the woman|non_person_coref]] with both [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and [[Eve|Eve|annotation]].

On [[September 27, 2018|DATE]], former actress [[Tanushree Dutta|Tanushree Dutta|annotation]] accused [[Nana Patekar|Nana Patekar|annotation]] of sexual harassment, which was the catalyst of the "[[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]]" movement in [[India|India|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Kojima|PERSON]] also believes it is extremely important for men to call out behaviors in others such as sexual harassment or having sex with someone who is unconscious and that every person who is not committing sexual violence is part of the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]], whether they are male or female.

As part of the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Shiori Itō|Shiori Itō|annotation]] went public alleging that [[Keiko Kojima|she|PERSON_coref]] was raped by [[Noriyuki Yamaguchi|Noriyuki Yamaguchi|annotation]], a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe|Shinzo Abe|annotation]], an admission [[Keiko Kojima|she|PERSON_coref]] says was unthinkable for a woman to do in [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Itō further stated that the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] Movement was small in [[Japan|Japan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] but that "what's happened in the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]] and elsewhere has provided an opening in our media to discuss sexual harassment and assault here, and to raise awareness".

nt during [[Keiko Kojima|her|PERSON_coref]] time with the group, motivated by the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]]. Nagata resigned following the lawsuit.

Former Mayor of [[Kathmandu|Kathmandu|annotation]] Keshav Sthapit has been accused of sexual harassment by [[two|NUMBER]] female office clerks of the [[Kathmandu|Kathmandu|alias_match_match_candidate]] Metropolitan Office, [[Rashmila Prajapati|PERSON]] and [[Ujjwala Maharjan|PERSON]], as a part of the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[Nepal|Nepal|annotation]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] accusations came in the context of the [[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]] debate and dominated Norwegian media for [[several weeks from December 2017|DATE]].

After the rape and murder of [[7-year-old|DURATION]] [[Zainab Ansari|PERSON]] in [[January 2018|DATE]], a wave of declarations were posted on [[Pakistan|Pakistan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] social media in #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] style.

Inspired by the women of the global [[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Marija Lukić|PERSON]] has stood up against [[Milutin Jeličić|PERSON]], [[Marija Lukić|her|PERSON_coref]] boss and the Mayor of [[Brus|PERSON]], a small town in central [[Serbia|Serbia|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and taken [[Marija Lukić|her|PERSON_coref]] accusations to court.

In [[South Korea|South Korea|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]] started to gain momentum as public prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon shared [[Marija Lukić|her|PERSON_coref]] experience of assault by a high-level prosecutor and oppression of government authorities on national television on [[January 29, 2018|DATE]].

After [[Seo|PERSON]]'s public admittance of sexual assault, the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]] spread quickly to other areas of society.

However, discussion on sexual assault and harassment preceded the [[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] with a series of hashtags under the scope of [[#000|MONEY]]_nae_seongpongnyeok (#sexual_violence_in_000) with particular attention in the arts and culture #yeonghwagye_nae_seongpongnyeok (#sexual_violence_in_the_film_industry).

On [[March 9, 2018|DATE]], Jo committed suicide following [[Lee Yountaek|his|PERSON_coref]] scandal, which triggered backlash against the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[South Korea|South Korea|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In response to the support of the [[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]], [[Citizen|ORGANIZATION]]'s

Action to Support the [[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] Movement was created in [[early 2018|DATE]]. It is a network of groups that work together to organize events and ma

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]] found an echo in the ongoing uproar raised by [[La Manada rape case|La Manada case|annotation]], crystallizing in numerous protests across [[Spain|the country|non_person_coref]].

[[Carl XVI Gustaf|Carl XVI Gustaf|annotation]], king of [[Sweden|Sweden|LOCATION_popular_entity]], said #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] is a positive movement that is good for society, and urged victims to come forward and share their stories.

A major part of the [[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]] debate in [[Sweden|Sweden|LOCATION_popular_entity]] focused on the affair surrounding [[Jean-Claude Arnault|Jean-Claude Arnault|annotation]] that led to several members of the [[Swedish Academy|Swedish Academy|annotation]] leaving their positions and [[Jean-Claude Arnault|Arnault|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] getting sentenced to prison for [[two|NUMBER]] sexual assaults.

Gender studies scholar [[Eva Lundgren|Eva Lundgren|annotation]] and legal scholar [[Jenny Westerstrand|PERSON]] wrote that the Swedish journalistic profession bore a large part of the blame in [[Sweden|Sweden|LOCATION_popular_entity]] for the problems the [[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]] debate had highlighted because Swedish journalists had systematically attacked critical discussion of and research on men's violence against women for over [[20 years|DURATION]].

[[Ellinor Skagegård|PERSON]] in the Swedish newspaper [[Svenska Dagbladet|Svenska Dagbladet|annotation]] wrote that during the [[Me Too movement|Me Too campaign|alias_match_article_entity]], it looks as if [[Eva Lundgren|Lundgren|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was right in [[Eva Lundgren|her|PERSON_coref]] research on men's violence against women.

[[Tunisia|Tunisia|LOCATION_popular_entity]]'s #EnaZeda movement (en: #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]]) began when politician [[Zouheir Makhlouf|PERSON]] was seen allegedly masturbating in a vehicle, whilst following a schoolgirl home.

Inspired by the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]], many women later expressed solidarity with the victims.

In the wake of #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]], a [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] activist shared [[Eva Lundgren|her|PERSON_coref]] [[2011|DATE]] story of being raped by a senior person in the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party|alias_match_single_candidate]], but being warned that [[Eva Lundgren|her|PERSON_coref]] career could be damaged if [[Eva Lundgren|she|PERSON_coref]] reported the incident.

Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament|annotation]] at [[Westminster|Westminster|alias_match_popular_entity]] following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|annotation]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood|alias_match_popular_entity]] earlier in [[October|DATE]], and the subsequent rise of [[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]].

Both [[Merrick|PERSON]] and [[Maltby|PERSON]] cited the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] as inspiring their allegations.

[[Cathy Newman|Newman|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was criticized for the interview and [[Rachael Revesz|PERSON]] of "[[The Independent|The Independent|annotation]]" wrote that subsequent abuse targeted at [[Cathy Newman|Newman|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was a symbol of a backlash against the [[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] related hashtag #HimToo emerged in popularity with the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]].

Although dating back to at least [[2015|DATE]], and initially associated with politics or casual communication, #[[Him Too movement|HimToo|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] took on new meanings associated with #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[2017|DATE]], with some using it to emphasize male victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and others using it to emphasize male perpetrators.

[[Michelle Malkin|Michelle Malkin|annotation]] expressed a suspicion that many stories in the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] would be exaggerated and accused news outlets of focusing on "hashtag trends spread by celebrities, anonymous claimants and bots".

In [[early 2018|DATE]], however, [[Fiorentino|PERSON]] was granted media interviews in which to revive the assault allegation while referring to the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Gary Oldman|He|PERSON_coref]] expressed trepidation about defending an accused male in the face of [[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]], saying, "I can see how coming out with a statement to combat an allegation must look.

Oldman's representative pointed to the [[2001|DATE]] courtroom outcome, accused [[Fiorentino|PERSON]] of using [[Me Too movement|Me Too|alias_match_article_entity]] as "convenient cover to further a personal vendetta", and requested that the press not allow the movement to be "misused as an instrument of harm to decent people by people with very bad intentions".

This is a common argument against the [[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] and alleged sexual assault victims alike.

Other women have stated #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] should examine only the worst types of abuse in order to prevent casting all men as perpetrators, or causing people to become numb to the problem.

Creator [[Tarana Burke|Tarana Burke|annotation]] has laid out specific goals for the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]], including: processing all untested rape kits in the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]], investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship, and schools.

[[Melania Trump|She|PERSON_coref]] has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must act to make the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] a success.

[[Melania Trump|She|PERSON_coref]] also supports the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] [[United States Congress|Congress|alias_match_single_candidate]] bill and hopes it will inspire similar legal changes in other parts of [[United States|the country|non_person_coref]].

[[Samantha Geimer|PERSON]], the victim of statutory rape by film director [[Roman Polanski|Roman Polanski|annotation]], said that "when it's used as a weapon to attack famous people or harm and demonize certain people I don't think that's ever what #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] was meant for and it's become kind of toxic and lost its value".

[[Jill Filipovic|She|PERSON_coref]] stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who "haven't actually touched anybody".

[[Ronan Farrow|Ronan Farrow|annotation]], who published the [[Harvey Weinstein|Weinstein|alias_match_single_candidate]] exposé in the "New Yorker" that helped start the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] resurgence (alongside "[[The New York Times|New York Times|annotation]]" reporters [[Megan Twohey|Megan Twohey|annotation]] and [[Jodi Kantor|Jodi Kantor|annotation]]), was asked in [[late December 2017|DATE]] whether [[Harvey Weinstein|he|PERSON_coref]] thought the movement had "gone too far".

[[Tony Robbins|He|PERSON_coref]] later apologized adding, "I need to get connected to the brave women of #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]]."

There have been many calls for the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] to include sex workers and sex trafficking victims.

[[Autumn|DATE]] [[Burris|PERSON]] stated that prostitution is like "#[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] on steroids" because the sexual harassment and assault described in #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] stories are frequent for women in prostitution.

[[Cinema of the United States|American|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] journalist [[Steven Thrasher|Steven Thrasher|annotation]] noted that, "There has been worry that the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] could lead to a sex panic.

Despite the prevalence of sexual misconduct, some have pointed out the lack of discussion in the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] regarding law-enforcement misconduct.

Former victim [[Farah Tanis|Farah Tanis|annotation]] stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]].

ement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] have a responsibility: "If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen."

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] #[[Me Too movement|MeToo movement|alias_match_article_entity]] has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people [[currently|DATE]] experiencing sexual abuse.

[[Tarana Burke|Tarana Burke|alias_match_match_candidate]] has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out [[one|NUMBER]] problematic aspect of #[[Me Too movement|MeToo|alias_match_article_entity]] is "All of this media attention is on the perpetrator.

Others criticize the main outreach of the [[Me Too movement|Me Too movement|alias_match_article_entity]] for failing to address the systemic imprisonment of abused women and men.

Being a landlocked country [[Zambia|Zambia|alias_match_match_candidate]] has no navy, although the [[Zambian Defence Force|Zambian Army|alias_match_article_entity]] maintains a maritime patrol unit for maintaining security on inland bodies of water.

After the occupation the [[Weerbaarheidsafdeling|WA|alias_match_article_entity]] was put to use in much the same way as the [[Sturmabteilung|SA|alias_match_single_candidate]] was, forcing owners of restaurants and cafes to put up signs saying "Jooden niet gewenscht" ("Jews not welcome") and harassing and provoking inhabitants of neighbourhoods with many Jewish inhabitants.

This led to the formation of ""knokploegen"", informal militias, and fights erupting between the [[Weerbaarheidsafdeling|WA|alias_match_article_entity]] and Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants.

On [[February 9, 1941|DATE]] there were riots on the [[Rembrandtplein|Rembrandtplein|annotation]] between the [[Weerbaarheidsafdeling|WA|alias_match_article_entity]] and Jewish youngsters.

Explaining why [[Charles Funke|he|PERSON_coref]] chose to make [[Central Saint Giles|the building|non_person_coref]] so colourful, [[Charles Funke|he|PERSON_coref]] said: "The colour idea came from observing the sudden surprise given by brilliant colours in that part of [[Wrocław|the city|non_person_coref]].

Although [[Rowan Moore|he|PERSON_coref]] was critical of the monotonous appearance of [[Central Saint Giles|the building|non_person_coref]]'s external windows, [[Rowan Moore|he|PERSON_coref]] gave "a resounding and unequivocal yes" to the question of whether the development succeeded, commending it for its "skilful construction of a new urban identity for a forgotten area and the generosity of its ground level engagement with context."

Tasked to manage the public libraries and to lead them into the [[Information Age|Information Age|annotation]] where non-print resources are making their mark, the [[National Library Board|NLB|alias_match_article_entity]] is aimed towards the creation of "borderless libraries," an initiative aimed at bringing the libraries closer to [[Singapore|Singaporeans|alias_match_single_candidate]], and to connect [[Singapore|Singaporeans|alias_match_single_candidate]] with the outside world.

. Commentators have occasionally suggested [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] for the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize|annotation]], but when Media Web named [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] its "print journalist of [[the year|DATE]]" in [[2006|DATE]] and asked [[Nicholas Kristof|him|PERSON_coref]] about that, it quoted [[Nicholas Kristof|him|PERSON_coref]] as saying: "I can't imagine it going to a scribbler like me. That's a total flight of fancy."

In [[2011|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was named [[one|NUMBER]] of [[seven|NUMBER]] "Top American Leaders" by the [[Harvard University|Harvard|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] Kennedy School and [[The Washington Post|The Washington Post|annotation]].

"[[Nicholas Kristof|His|PERSON_coref]] writing has reshaped the field of opinion journalism," [[The Washington Post|The Washington Post|annotation]] explained in granting [[Nobel Peace Prize|the award|non_person_coref]].

Earlier, in [[2007|DATE]], [[U.S. News & World Report|U.S. News & World Report|annotation]] named [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] [[one|NUMBER]] of "[[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]]'s Best Leaders."

In [[2013|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was awarded the [[Goldsmith Award for Career Excellence|ORGANIZATION]] in Journalism by [[Harvard University|Harvard University|alias_match_match_candidate]].

In [[the same year|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was named an International Freedom Conductor by the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center|National Underground Railroad Freedom Center|annotation]], largely for [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] work exposing human trafficking and linking it to modern slavery.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s books, all best-sellers and all co-authored with [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] wife [[Sheryl WuDunn|Sheryl WuDunn|annotation]], include "[[China Wakes|China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power|annotation]]" ([[1994|DATE]]), "Thunder from the [[New York City|East|alias_match_single_candidate]]: Portrait of a Rising Asia" ([[1999|DATE]]), "[[Half the Sky|Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide|annotation]]" ([[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]], [[September 2009|DATE]]), "A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity" ([[2014|DATE]]) and "Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope" ([[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]], [[January 2020|DATE]]).

Among many of the motivations for writing "[[Half the Sky|Half the Sky|alias_match_match_candidate]]" [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] explained to [[Jane Wales|PERSON]] of the World Affairs Council of Northern [[California|California|alias_match_popular_entity]] that the idea for the book was sparked by the [[1989|DATE]] [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square protests|annotation]].

After covering the protests, which resulted in some [[500|NUMBER]] deaths, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn|WuDunn|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] were shocked to learn that roughly [[39,000|NUMBER]] [[Hong Kong|Chinese|alias_match_single_candidate]] girls died [[each year|SET]] because they were not given the same access to food and medical care as boys.

Yet [[Sheryl WuDunn|WuDunn|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] could not find coverage of these deaths, even though they were far more numerous than the casualties at [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square|alias_match_single_candidate]].

That led them to dig deeper into questions of gender, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] said.

In a column titled "[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Day After" in [[September 2002|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote, "In [[one|NUMBER]] Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy, and perhaps a drift toward civil war.

In the same article, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote, "Will we be safer if we invade?

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] continues in this column, "Frankly, it seems a bad idea to sacrifice our troops' lives -- along with [[billions of dollars|MONEY]] -- in a way that may add to our vulnerability."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was criticized at the [[time|DATE]] for reporting that Iraqis opposed an American invasion.

In [[2018|DATE]] on the [[15th anniversary|DATE]] of [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]], [[Andrew Sullivan|Andrew Sullivan|annotation]] apologized to [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] in a tweet for criticizing [[Nicholas Kristof|him|PERSON_coref]] in [[2002|DATE]] for opposing [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]].

On [[May 6, 2003|DATE]], [[less than two months|DURATION]] into [[World War II|the war|non_person_coref]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] published an op-ed column titled "Missing in Action: Truth," in which [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] questioned whether the intelligence gathered by the [[Bush|PERSON]] administration, which purportedly indicated that [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein|PERSON_popular_entity]] possessed weapons of mass destruction, was either faked or manipulated.

In this article, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] cited as [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] source a "former ambassador" who had traveled to [[Niger|Niger|LOCATION_popular_entity]] in [[early 2002|DATE]] and reported back to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency|annotation]] ([[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]) and the [[United States Department of State|State Department|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] that the uranium "allegations were unequivocally wrong and based on forged documents."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] added, "[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] envoy's debunking of the forgery was passed around the administration and seemed to be accepted—except that [[Bill Clinton|President|alias_match_single_candidate]] [[Bush|PERSON]] and the [[United States Department of State|State Department|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] kept citing it anyway."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s [[May 6|DATE]] article was mentioned in the federal indictment of [[Scooter Libby|Scooter Libby|alias_match_match_candidate]] as a key point in time, and a contributing factor that caused [[Scooter Libby|Libby|alias_match_single_candidate]] to inquire about the identity of the "envoy" and later divulge the secret identity of [[Scooter Libby|his|PERSON_coref]] wife to reporters.

In [[Scooter Libby|his|PERSON_coref]] columns, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] revealed the documents detailing the proposal and argued that the "grand bargain" proposal was killed by hardliners in the [[Bush|PERSON]] administration.

According to [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]], that was an "appalling mistake" since "the Iranian proposal was promising and certainly should have been followed up.

Kristof further believes that even if the grand bargain is not [[currently|DATE]] feasible, there is still an option for what [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] calls a "mini-bargain," a more modest proposal for normalizing U.S.-Iranian relations.

In [[2002|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote a series of columns indirectly suggesting that [[Steven Hatfill|Steven Hatfill|annotation]], a former [[United States Army|U.S. Army|ORGANIZATION_popular_redirect]] germ-warfare researcher named as a "person of interest" by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI|annotation]] might be a "likely culprit" in the anthrax attacks.

In [[July 2004|DATE]], Dr. [[Steven Hatfill|Hatfill|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] sued the "[[The New York Times|Times|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]" and [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] for libel, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Subsequently, Dr. [[Steven Hatfill|Hatfill|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] voluntarily dismissed [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] as a defendant in the case when it became clear that the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|U.S. District Court|annotation]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria, Va.|annotation]], lacked personal jurisdiction over [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] suit continued against the "[[The New York Times|Times|alias_match_multiple_candidates]]" itself, but was dismissed in [[2004|DATE]] on the basis that allegations within [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s articles did not constitute defamation, albeit they appeared untrue.

Then in [[January 2007|DATE]], presiding judge [[Claude M. Hilton|Claude M. Hilton|annotation]] again dismissed the suit, ruling that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s anthrax articles were "cautiously worded" and asserted that the scientist may perhaps be innocent.

Judge [[Claude M. Hilton|Hilton|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] "made efforts to avoid implicating [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] guilt" and that "Mr. [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] reminded readers to assume plaintiff's innocence."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] praised dismissal of the suit, commenting that [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] was "really pleased that the judge recognized the importance of this kind of reporting" and that it was "terrific to have a judgment that protects journalism at a time when the press has had a fair number of rulings against it."

[[Steven Hatfill|His|PERSON_coref]] biography says [[Steven Hatfill|he|PERSON_coref]] has made [[11|NUMBER]] trips to [[Darfur|the region|non_person_coref]], some illegally by sneaking in from [[Chad|Chad|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and on at least [[one|NUMBER]] occasion [[Steven Hatfill|he|PERSON_coref]] was detained at a checkpoint when the authorities seized [[Steven Hatfill|his|PERSON_coref]] interpreter and [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] refused to leave [[Nicholas Kristof|him|PERSON_coref]] behind.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s reporting from [[Sudan|Sudan|alias_match_popular_entity]] has been both praised and criticized.

[[Robert DeVecchi|PERSON]], [[past|DATE]] president of the [[International Rescue Committee|International Rescue Committee|annotation]], told the [[Council on Foreign Relations|Council on Foreign Relations|annotation]]: "[[Nicholas Kristof|Nicholas Kristof|alias_match_article_entity]] ... had an unprecedented impact in single-handedly mobilizing world attention to this crisis.

[[New York City|New York|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Magazine said that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] "single-handedly focused the world's attention on [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]]," and the Save [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]] Coalition said that "[[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] is the person most responsible for getting this issue into [[United States|America|LOCATION_popular_redirect]]'s consciousness and the resulting efforts to resolve it."

[[Samantha Power|Samantha Power|annotation]], the author of [[A Problem from Hell|A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide|annotation]], the [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize-winning|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] book on genocide, told an [[American Jewish World Service|American Jewish World Service|annotation]] audience that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was probably the person the [[Janjaweed militia|ORGANIZATION]] in [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]] most wanted to kill.

In [[June 2008|DATE]], the actress [[Mia Farrow|Mia Farrow|annotation]] spoke as [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was honored with the [[Anne Frank Award|PERSON]], declaring: "[[Nicholas Kristof|Nick Kristof|alias_match_article_entity]] was [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[first|ORDINAL]] to publicly insist that the words Never Again mean something for the people of [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]].

For [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] courage and [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] conviction in telling tell searing truths, [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] is the voice of our collective conscience, demanding we bear witness to the [[first|ORDINAL]] genocide of [[the 21st century|DATE]] and encouraging us not to sit by while innocents die.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Nicholas Kristof|alias_match_article_entity]] is that person."

For [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] coverage of [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]], [[Ann Curry|Ann Curry|annotation]] of [[NBC|NBC|annotation]] suggested that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was "the modern journalist who showed courage and leadership comparable to the great [[Edward R. Murrow|Edward R. Murrow|annotation]]."

On the other hand, some commentators have criticized [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] for focusing on atrocities by Arab militias in [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]] and downplaying atrocities by non-Arab militias.

A book by [[Mahmood Mamdani|PERSON]] of [[Columbia University|Columbia University|ORGANIZATION_popular_entity]], "Saviors and Survivors," criticized [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s reporting for over-simplifying a complex historically-rooted conflict and packaging it as "genocide."

[[Sudan|Sudan|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s government has also objected that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s reporting exaggerates the scale of suffering and ignores the nuances of tribal conflicts in [[Darfur|Darfur|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[The New York Times|The|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] [[Sudan|Sudan|alias_match_popular_entity]] government and pro-government news media criticized [[Nicholas Kristof|him|PERSON_coref]] in [[March 2012|DATE]] for sneaking into [[Sudan|Sudan|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s [[Nuba Mountains|LOCATION]] region without a visa, to report on hunger and bombings there, saying that [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] illegal entry was "shameful and improper."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Nicholas Kristof|alias_match_article_entity]] argues that sweatshops are, if not a good thing, then defensible as a way for workers to improve their lives and for impoverished countries to transform themselves into industrial economies.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] is critical of the way "well-meaning [[Central Intelligence Agency|American|alias_match_single_candidate]] university students regularly campaign against sweatshops", particularly the Anti-sweatshop movement's strategy of encouraging consumer boycotts against sweatshop-produced imports.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn|WuDunn|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] counter that the sweatshop model is a primary reason why [[Taiwan|Taiwan|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[South Korea|South Korea|LOCATION_popular_entity]]—which accepted sweatshops as the price of development—are [[today|DATE]] modern countries with low rates of infant mortality and high levels of education, while [[India|India|LOCATION_popular_entity]]—which generally has resisted sweatshops—suffers from a high rate of infant mortality.

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] criticizes [[Israel|Israel|alias_match_match_candidate]] for what [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] views as collective punishment of [[Gaza Strip|Gazans|annotation]] and holds that the lack of negotiations only strengthens extremists.

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] also advocates removing [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlement|annotation]]s from [[Hebron|Hebron|annotation]] since "the financial cost is mind-boggling, and the diplomatic cost is greater ".

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] contrasts "[[two|NUMBER]] Israels": an oppressive security state in the [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian territories|annotation]] and a "paragon of justice, decency, fairness – and peace," in the work of [[Israel|Israeli|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] human rights activists, journalists, and jurists.

During the [[First Libyan Civil War|2011 Libyan civil war|annotation]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote that the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] should create a no-fly zone and also use milit

. [[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] remarked, "let's remember the risks of inaction – and not psych ourselves out. For crying out loud!"

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] then suggested that [[United States Armed Forces|the military|non_person_coref]] could serve as a model for improving [[United States Armed Forces|American|alias_match_single_line_candidate]] society along those lines.

e and daycare," and hinted that the ideas in [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s column resembled fascism

In a [[2011|DATE]] "[[The New York Times|New York Times|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]" op-ed, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] wrote that [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] is "not a fan" of teachers' unions because [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] maintains that unions encourage teachers to accept low wages in return for job security ([[future|DATE]] seniority benefits, pensions, and protection from arbitrary dismissal).

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] feels that such protections have the effect of protecting bad teachers, who then have to be fired for cause – a time-consuming, drawn out process – rather than being subject to being summarily fired at will.

Instead, [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] advocates that teachers give up these rights and protections in exchange for receiving much higher average starting salaries.

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] suggests that instead of the [[current|DATE]] figure of [[$39,000|MONEY]] for teacher starting salaries, entering teaching salaries start at [[$65,000|MONEY]], a figure which [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] believes will have the effect of attracting and retaining more talented individuals to the profession.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] has written several articles on the controversial use of flame retardants in furniture, most [[recently|DATE]] in a [[November 2013|DATE]] piece titled "Danger Lurks in that [[Mickey Mouse Couch|PERSON]]."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] argues that legislative mandates of flame retardants in furniture are a result of powerfully influential lobbyists representing the chemical industry.

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] claims that flame retardants are ineffective in saving lives, yet pose an increasingly evid

. In [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] words, "These flame retardants represent a dizzying corporate scandal. It's a story of corporate greed, deceit and skulduggery."

In [[2012|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] went as far as to write that flame retardants in furniture are "a case study of everything that is wrong with money politics."

[[Nicholas Kristof|He|PERSON_coref]] concluded that article, "Are You Safe On That Sofa?"

by arguing that the [[United States|United States|annotation]] needs not only safer couches but also a political system less distorted by what [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] calls "toxic money."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s stances on flame retardants have come under fire from the chemical industry, who call [[Nicholas Kristof|his|PERSON_coref]] opeds "overdramatic" and "misleading."

On [[December 4, 2020|DATE]], [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] published a lengthy look at the website [[Pornhub|Pornhub|annotation]] and at its parent company, [[MindGeek|MindGeek|annotation]].

Kristof examined how [[Pornhub|Pornhub|alias_match_match_candidate]] routinely has pornographic content on its site involving minors, and [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] wrote about how [[Pornhub|Pornhub|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s reviewers often have to make judgment calls on whether the user-submitted pornographic videos feature underage performers and whether the videos depict individuals engaging in nonconsensual sex.

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s article included interviews with underage victims who have appeared in videos on [[Pornhub|Pornhub|alias_match_match_candidate]] that were submitted by people who filmed them, in some cases while being raped, and [[Nicholas Kristof|he|PERSON_coref]] reported that several such victims had attempted suicide.

[[Pornhub|Pornhub|alias_match_match_candidate]] denied [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s claims, calling them "irresponsible and flagrantly untrue."

[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] implored leaders of [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]], where [[MindGeek|MindGeek|alias_match_match_candidate]] is based, to consider why [[Canada|Canada|LOCATION_popular_entity]] hosts a website that profits off videos featuring rape and children.

After [[MasterCard|ORGANIZATION]], Visa and Discover banned payments to [[MindGeek|MindGeek|alias_match_match_candidate]] owned sites based on [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s report, several news agencies and organizations pointed out that [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s solution primarily impacted the many legal, consensual sex workers who rely on [[MindGeek|MindGeek|alias_match_match_candidate]] sites for income.

The name of [[Kirada|Kirada|alias_match_article_entity]] name appears on numerous coins at the end of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan Empire|annotation]] and the beginning of the rule of the [[Kidarites|Kidarite Huns|annotation]] in the area of Central and Western [[Punjab|Punjab|annotation]] in [[India|India|annotation]], in the period circa [[340-345|NUMBER]] CE.

The name "Ga-ḍa-ha-ra" (for [[Gandhara|the region|non_person_coref]] of [[Gandhara|Gandhara|annotation]]) appears vertically as a monogram in the right field of the coins of [[Kirada|Kirada|alias_match_article_entity]], as on some slightly earlier coins signed [[Samudragupta|Samudragupta|annotation]], or subsequent coins of other early [[Kidarites|Kidarite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] rulers named [[Yasada|PERSON]], [[Peroz (Kidarite)|Peroz|annotation]] and [[Kidara I|Kidara|annotation]].

The coins of [[Kirada|Kirada|alias_match_article_entity]] would have followed those in the name of [[Samudragupta|Samudragupta|annotation]] in [[Gandhara|Gandhara|alias_match_match_candidate]], and it is thought that [[Kirada|Kirada|alias_match_article_entity]] was succeeded as [[Kidarites|Kidarite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] ruler by another [[Kidarites|Kidarite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] [[Peroz (Kidarite)|Peroz|annotation]] and then the famous [[Kidara I|Kidara|annotation]].

[[Kirada|Kirada|alias_match_article_entity]] also struck in [[Balkh|Balkh|annotation]] coins in the name of the last [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom|Kushano-Sasanian|annotation]] ruler [[Varahran Kushanshah|Varahran I Kushanshah|annotation]] circa CE [[340-345|NUMBER]], incorporating the [[Kidarites|Kidarite|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] tamga which replaced the nandipada which had been in use before the rise of the [[Kidarites|Kidarites|alias_match_match_candidate]].

Barne's father had established himself as co-proprietor of the Borough and controlled [[one|NUMBER]] seat; on [[Barne Barne|his|PERSON_coref]] father's death in [[1777|DATE]], [[Barne Barne|Barne|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s eldest brother declined to fill the vacancy and so [[Barne Barne|Barne|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] accepted the offer, hoping to obtain, by voting with the administration, a paid office.

[[Barne Barne|He|PERSON_coref]] was eventually offered a post, as a Commissioner of Taxes, and, on accepting it, resigned [[Barne Barne|his|PERSON_coref]] seat in [[1791|DATE]].

Thus, the [[two|NUMBER]] seats belonging to the Borough were essentially controlled by local land-lords; by [[1764|DATE]], it was in the hands of the [[Barne Barne|Barne|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]] and Vanneck families, who were co-proprietors of the parish.

As a [[Member of parliament|Member|alias_match_single_candidate]], [[Barne Barne|Barne|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] tended to vote with the administration, hoping to secure himself a commission of some kind; [[Miles Barne (politician born 1746)|he|PERSON_coref]] is not known to have spoken in debate.

Having been returned again in [[1790|DATE]], [[Barne Barne|Barne|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was offered the position of a Commissioner of Taxes in [[1791|DATE]] and resigned from the [[House|ORGANIZATION]].

Professor [[Phillip E. Wegner|Wegner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] has published [[five|NUMBER]] books and numerous articles on utopian fiction, contemporary literature, film, cultural studies, [[Marxism|Marxism|annotation]], and science fiction.

[[Phillip E.

Wegner|Wegner|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] has called "the most significant contemporary theorist of periodization."

For example, [[Phillip E. Wegner|his|PERSON_coref]] book "Life Between [[Two|NUMBER]] Deaths" examines the "specific cultural period" of [[the 1990s|DATE]], which [[Phillip E.

In [[Phillip E. Wegner|his|PERSON_coref]] [[first|ORDINAL]] book, "Imaginary Communities", [[Phillip E.

In "Shockwaves of Possibility," [[Phillip E.

Rather, [[Utopianism|ORGANIZATION]] is fundamental to the very narrative dynamic of this vital modern practice."

MPLA

The [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola|annotation]], for some [[years|DURATION]] called the [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola – Labour Party|annotation]] ([[MPLA|Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola|alias_match_article_entity]] – Partido do Trabalho, [[MPLA|MPLA|annotation]]), is a political party that has ruled [[Angola|Angola|annotation]] since [[Portugal|the country|non_person_coref]]'s independence from [[Portugal|Portugal|annotation]] in [[1975|DATE]].

The [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] fought against the [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese army|annotation]] in the [[Angolan War of Independence|Angolan War of Independence|annotation]] from [[1961|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1974|DATE]], and defeated the [[National Union|ORGANIZATION]] for the Total Independence of [[Angola|Angola|alias_match_match_candidate]] ([[UNITA|UNITA|annotation]]) and the [[National Liberation Front of Angola|National Liberation Front of Angola|annotation]] ([[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]), [[two|NUMBER]] other anti-colonial movements, in the [[Angolan Civil War|Angolan Civil War|annotation]] of [[1975|DATE]]–[[2002|DATE]].

On [[December 10, 1956|DATE]], in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo|annotation]]-ruled [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese Angola|annotation]], the tiny underground [[Angola|Angolan|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] Communist Party (PCA) merged with [[MPLA|the party|non_person_coref]] of the [[United Struggle|ORGANIZATION]] for Africans in [[Angola|Angola|alias_match_match_candidate]] (PLUA) to form the [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola|alias_match_article_entity]], with [[Viriato da Cruz|Viriato da Cruz|annotation]], the President of the [[PCA|ORGANIZATION]], as Secretary General.

Later other groups merged into [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]], such as Movement for the National Independence of [[Angola|Angola|alias_match_match_candidate]] (MINA) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of [[Angola|Angola|alias_match_match_candidate]] (FDLA).

The [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]]'s core base includes the [[Ambundu|Ambundu|annotation]] ethnic group and the educated intelligentsia of the capital city, [[Luanda|Luanda|annotation]].

[[MPLA|the party|non_person_coref]] formerly had links to European and [[Soviet Union|Soviet|annotation]] communist parties but is [[now|DATE]] a full-member of the [[Socialist International|Socialist International|annotation]] grouping of social democratic parties.

The armed wing of [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] was the [[People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola|People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola|annotation]] ([[People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola|FAPLA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]).

In [[1961|DATE]], the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] joined the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|annotation]] ([[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]), its fraternal party in [[Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau|annotation]] and [[Cape Verde|Cabo Verde|annotation]], in direct combat against the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empire|annotation]] in [[Africa|Africa|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

In [[the early 1970s|DATE]], the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]]'s guerrilla activities were more and more reduced, due to the counter-insurgency campaigns of the [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portuguese military|annotation]].

Maintaining control over [[Luanda|Luanda|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the lucrative oil fields of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] coastline, [[Agostinho Neto|Agostinho Neto|annotation]], the leader of the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]], declared the independence of the [[Portugal|Portuguese|alias_match_multiple_line_candidates]] [[Portuguese Angola|Overseas Province of Angola|annotation]] as the [[People's Republic of Angola|People's Republic of Angola|annotation]] on [[November 11, 1975|DATE]], in accordance with the [[Alvor Agreement|Alvor Accords|annotation]].

These differences reignited civil war between [[UNITA|UNITA|alias_match_match_candidate]] & [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]], with the latter winning the upper hand.

[[Cuba|Cuba|annotation]] deployed thousands of troops in [[1975|DATE]] to aid the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] against [[South Africa|South African|alias_match_single_candidate]] intervention, with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|annotation]] aiding both [[Cuba|Cuba|alias_match_match_candidate]] and the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] government during [[Angolan Civil War|the war|non_person_coref]].

In [[November 1980|DATE]], the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] had all but pushed [[UNITA|UNITA|alias_match_match_candidate]] into the bush, and the [[South Africa|South African|alias_match_single_candidate]] forces withdrew.

In [[1976|DATE]] the [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] withdrew its troops to their bases in [[Zaire|Zaire|alias_match_match_candidate]], while part of them joined the [[32|NUMBER]] Battalion formed by [[South Africa|South Africa|alias_match_match_candidate]] in order to receive anti-[[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] [[Angola|Angolans|alias_match_single_candidate]].

At its [[first|ORDINAL]] congress, in [[1977|DATE]], the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] adopted [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxism–Leninism|annotation]] as [[MPLA|the party|non_person_coref]] ideology and added "Partido do Trabalho" ([[Labour Party|ORGANIZATION]]) to its name.

After [[Nito Alves|PERSON]]'s attempted "coup" in [[1977|DATE]], [[Agostinho Neto|Neto|alias_match_single_candidate]] ordered the killing of suspected followers and sympathisers of "orthodox communism" inside and outside [[MPLA|the party|non_person_coref]].

During the coup, [[Cuba|Cuban|alias_match_single_candidate]] forces stationed in [[Angola|Angola|alias_match_match_candidate]] sided with the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] leadership against the coup organizers.

Estimates for the number of [[Nito Alves|PERSON]] followers killed by [[Cuba|Cuban|alias_match_single_candidate]] and [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] troops in the aftermath, range from [[2,000|NUMBER]] [[to|NUMBER]] [[70,000|NUMBER]] dead, with some placing the death toll at [[18,000|NUMBER]] killed.

When the Cold [[Vietnam War|War|alias_match_single_candidate]] ended in [[1991|DATE]], the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] abandoned its [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist ideology|alias_match_redirect_candidate]], and on its [[third|ORDINAL]] congress in [[December|DATE]], [[MPLA|the party|non_person_coref]] declared social democracy to be its official ideology.

The [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] emerged victorious in [[Angola|Angola|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[1992|DATE]] general election, but [[eight|NUMBER]] opposition parties rejected the election as rigged.

Tens of thousands of [[UNITA|UNITA|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] sympathizers were subsequently killed nationwide by [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] forces, in what is known as the [[Halloween Massacre|LOCATION]], and the civil war resumed.

Human rights observers have accused the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] of "genocidal atrocities," "systematic extermination," "war crimes" and "crimes against humanity during the civil war."

Political scientist [[Rudolph Rummel|Rudolph Rummel|annotation]] estimated that the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] were responsible for between [[100,000|NUMBER]] [[and|NUMBER]] [[200,000|NUMBER]] deaths in democide from [[1975|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1987|DATE]].

During both the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Portuguese Colonial War|annotation]] and the [[Angolan Civil War|Angolan Civil War|annotation]], the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]] received military and humanitarian support primarily from the governments of [[Algeria|Algeria|annotation]], the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian People's Republic|annotation]], [[East Germany|East Germany|annotation]], [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands|annotation]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|annotation]], the Congo, [[Cuba|Cuba|annotation]], [[Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau|annotation]], [[Morocco|Morocco|annotation]], the [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambican People's Republic|annotation]], [[Nigeria|Nigeria|annotation]], [[North Korea|North Korea|annotation]], the [[Polish People's Republic|Polish People's Republic|annotation]], [[China|China|annotation]], the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian Socialist Republic|annotation]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe|annotation]], [[Somalia|Somalia|annotation]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union|annotation]], [[Sudan|Sudan|annotation]], [[Tanzania|Tanzania|annotation]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya|annotation]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia|annotation]].

While [[China|China|alias_match_match_candidate]] did briefly support the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]], it also actively supported the [[MPLA|MPLA|alias_match_article_entity]]'s enemies, the [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and later [[UNITA|UNITA|alias_match_match_candidate]], during [[Angolan Civil War|the war|non_person_coref]] for independence and the civil war.

In the [[1992|DATE]] elections, [[MPLA|MPLA-PT|alias_match_article_entity]] won [[53.74%|PERCENT]] of the votes and [[129|NUMBER]] out of [[227|NUMBER]] seats in parliament; however, [[eight|NUMBER]] opposition parties rejected the [[1992|DATE]] elections as rigged.

[[Brian Wilson|Brian Wilson|PERSON_popular_entity]] promptly readied several songs [[Brian Wilson|he|PERSON_coref]] had already been working on (mainly with radio DJ [[Roger Christian (songwriter)|Roger Christian|annotation]]) and the band hastily went through recording sessions to put "[[Little Deuce Coupe|Little Deuce Coupe|alias_match_article_entity]]" on the record shop racks, remarkably, [[one month|DURATION]] after "[[Surfer Girl|Surfer Girl|annotation]]" had come out.

Although [[Nick Venet|Nick Venet|annotation]] was listed as producer for "[[Shut Down (Beach Boys song)|Shut Down|alias_match_single_candidate]]" and [[Murry Wilson|Murry Wilson|annotation]] for "[[409|NUMBER]]", the official producer's credit for the entire "[[Little Deuce Coupe|Little Deuce Coupe|alias_match_article_entity]]" album cites only [[Brian Wilson|Brian Wilson|PERSON_popular_entity]].

After [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]] came back from the animation studio in [[Korea|Korea|LOCATION_popular_entity]], the staff noticed the light was colored blue, making [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa|alias_match_single_candidate]] look like "a [[The Smurfs|Smurf|annotation]]".

The beginning of [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]], in which [[Homer|Homer|alias_match_popular_entity]] has a dream of himself as an ape, is a reference to the Dawn of Man sequence from the [[1968|DATE]] science fiction film "[[2001|DATE]]: A Space Odyssey".

The musical chords used in [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]] are the same as in the film but shortened.

This is parodied in [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]] when [[Principal Skinner|Principal Skinner|annotation]] rushes the child off the stage before [[Principal Skinner|he|PERSON_coref]] is able to finish the [[first|ORDINAL]] line of the refrain.

In its original American broadcast, "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" finished [[35th|ORDINAL]] in the ratings for [[the week of November 4|DATE]]–[[10|NUMBER]], [[1991|DATE]], with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating|annotation]] of [[13.8|NUMBER]], equivalent to approximately [[12.7 million|NUMBER]] viewing households.

"[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" was released with [[Treehouse of Horror II|the episode|non_person_coref]] "[[Treehouse of Horror II|Treehouse of Horror II|annotation]]" on a [[VHS|VHS|annotation]] collection in [[1999|DATE]], called "Best of the [[The Simpsons|Simpsons|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]".

Cinema Blend's [[Bryce Wilson|PERSON]] called "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" [[one|NUMBER]] of the best [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa|alias_match_single_candidate]] episodes, and added that the only words to describe it are "funny as hell".

[[Nate Meyers|PERSON]] of Digitally Obsessed rated [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]] a5 (of [[5|NUMBER]]), praising it for its references to "[[The Godfather|The Godfather|alias_match_match_candidate]]" and "[[2001|DATE]]: A Space Odyssey" which "film buffs will find uproarious".

Meyers added that [[Homer|Homer|alias_match_popular_entity]]'s and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa|alias_match_single_candidate]]'s relationship is "the heart of [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]], showing [[Homer|Homer|alias_match_popular_entity]] to be more than just a brute".

[[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]]'s reference to "[[The Godfather|The Godfather|alias_match_match_candidate]] " was named the [[seventh|ORDINAL]] greatest film reference in the history of [[The Simpsons|the show|non_person_coref]] by "[[Total Film|Total Film|annotation]]s [[Nathan Ditum|PERSON]].

"[[The Guardian|The Guardian|annotation]]s [[David Eklid|PERSON]] said episodes such as "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" and "[[Stark Raving Dad|Stark Raving Dad|annotation]]" make season [[three|NUMBER]] "pretty much [the] best season of any television show, ever".

[[Molly Griffin|PERSON]] of "[[The Observer|The Observer|alias_match_popular_entity]]" commented that "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" is [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[third|ORDINAL]] season's episodes that "make [[The Simpsons|the show|non_person_coref]] into the cultural force it is [[today|DATE]]".

Bill [[Gibron of DVD Verdict|ORGANIZATION]] said "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" is a "priceless part" of [[The Simpsons|the show|non_person_coref]] because of its "meshing of old storylines with new experiences, combined with some of the best jokes in the series".

Gibron gave [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]] a perfect score of [[100|NUMBER]].

DVD Movie Guide's [[Colin Jacobson|PERSON]], however, gave [[Lisa's Pony|the episode|non_person_coref]] a less positive review, commenting that episodes "in which [[Homer|Homer|alias_match_popular_entity]] has to redeem himself to others aren't a rarity, and '[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]' falls in the middle of that genre's pack.

I like '[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]' but don't consider it to offer a great program."

According to [[Greg Suarez|PERSON]] of The Digital Bits, "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" is considered a fan favorite.

[[Paul Cantor|Paul Cantor|annotation]], a professor of English at the [[University of Virginia|University of Virginia|annotation]], utilized "[[Lisa's Pony|Lisa's Pony|alias_match_article_entity]]" as an example that "[[The Simpsons|The Simpsons|alias_match_match_candidate]]" does not promote negative morals and values, which some critics have criticized [[The Simpsons|the show|non_person_coref]] for.

Ruth Virginia Brazzil

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|Ruth Virginia Brazzil|annotation]], sometimes known as [[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|Ruth Brazzil Roome|annotation]] ([[September 12, 1889|DATE]] – [[May 22, 1976|DATE]]) was a [[Texas|Texas|annotation]] lawyer and jurist.

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|She|PERSON_coref]] was a member of the [[All-Woman Supreme Court|All-Woman Supreme Court|annotation]] of [[1925|DATE]].

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|Brazzil|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was the eldest child of [[William N.|PERSON]] and [[Winnie Shelman Brazzil|PERSON]], and was a native of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler, Texas|annotation]].

Unlike the other [[two|NUMBER]] women with whom [[Winnie Shelman Brazzil|she|PERSON_coref]] would serve on the court, [[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|Brazzil|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] is said to have been an opponent of women's suffrage and participation in politics.

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|Brazzil|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] was the last of [[three|NUMBER]] members appointed to the special all-female session of the [[Supreme Court of Texas|Supreme Court of Texas|annotation]] by [[Governor of Texas|Governor of Texas|annotation]] [[Pat Morris Neff|Pat M.

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|Brazzil|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] left [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] in [[the 1920s|DATE]] and moved to [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton County|annotation]], where [[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|she|PERSON_coref]] married rice farmer [[Roy Roome|PERSON]] in [[December 1927|DATE]].

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|She|PERSON_coref]] divorced [[Roy Roome|him|PERSON_coref]] within [[two weeks|DURATION]], but kept [[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|her|PERSON_coref]] married name.

[[Ruth Virginia Brazzil|She|PERSON_coref]] appears to have given up the practice of law at this time, moving to the [[Texas Hill Country|Texas Hill Country|annotation]] sometime [[late in the 1920s|DATE]] or [[early in the 1930s|DATE]].

Black Hills

The [[Black Hills|Black Hills|annotation]] (Ȟe Sápa; Moʼȯhta-voʼhonáaeva; awaxaawi shiibisha) are a small and isolated mountain range rising from the [[Great Plains|Great Plains|annotation]] of [[North America|North America|annotation]] in western [[South Dakota|South Dakota|annotation]] and extending into [[Wyoming|Wyoming|annotation]], [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]].

. [[Black Hills|The Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] encompass the [[Black Hills National Forest|Black Hills National Forest|annotation]]

. The name "[[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]]" is a translation of the [[Lakota language|Lakota|annotation]] "[[Black Hills|Pahá Sápa|alias_match_article_entity]]". The hills are so called because of their dark appearance from a distance, as they are covered in evergreen trees.

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans|annotation]] have a long history in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

After conquering the [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne|annotation]] in [[1776|DATE]], the [[Lakota people|Lakota|annotation]] took the territory of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]], which became central to their culture.

In [[1868|DATE]], the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] government signed the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868|annotation]], establishing the [[Great Sioux Reservation|Great Sioux Reservation|annotation]] west of the [[Missouri River|Missouri River|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and exempting the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] from all white settlement forever.

The [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]] government took the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] and in [[1889|DATE]] reassigned the [[Lakota people|Lakota|alias_match_single_line_candidate]], against their wishes, to [[five|NUMBER]] smaller reservations in western [[South Dakota|South Dakota|alias_match_match_candidate]], selling off [[9 million|NUMBER]] acres of their former land.

Unlike most of [[South Dakota|South Dakota|alias_match_match_candidate]], the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] were settled by European Americans primarily from population centers to the west and south of [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]], as miners flocked there from earlier gold boom locations in [[Colorado|Colorado|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and [[Montana|Montana|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

As the economy of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] has shifted from natural resources (mining and timber) since [[the late 20th century|DATE]], the hospitality and tourism industries have grown to take its place.

Locals tend to divide the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] into [[two|NUMBER]] areas: "The Southern Hills" and "The [[North America|Northern|alias_match_single_candidate]] Hills".

The [[first|ORDINAL]] Rally was held on [[August 14, 1938|DATE]], and the [[75th Rally|ORGANIZATION]] in [[2015|DATE]] saw more than [[one million|NUMBER]] bikers visit the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Devils Tower|Devils Tower National Monument|annotation]], located in the [[Wyoming|Wyoming|alias_match_match_candidate]] [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]], is an important nearby attraction and was the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]]' [[first|ORDINAL]] national monument.

Although the written history of [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]] begins with the [[Lakota people|Sioux|alias_match_single_candidate]] domination of [[Black Hills|the land|non_person_coref]] over the native [[Arikara|LOCATION]] tribes, researchers have carbon-dating and stratigraphic records to analyze the early history of [[Mount Rushmore|the area|non_person_coref]].

Stratigraphic records indicate environmental changes in [[Black Hills|the land|non_person_coref]], such as flood and drought patterns.

They claimed [[Black Hills|the land|non_person_coref]], which they called "Ȟe Sápa" (Black Mountains).

The mountains commonly became known as the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

François and [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye|Louis de La Vérendrye|annotation]] probably traveled near the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] in [[1743|DATE]].

In order to secure safe passage of settlers on the [[Oregon Trail|ORGANIZATION]], and end intertribal warfare, the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]] government proposed the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty|annotation]] of [[1868|DATE]], establishing the [[Great Sioux Reservation|Great Sioux Reservation|annotation]] west of the [[Missouri River|Missouri River|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and acknowledging their control of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

In this treaty, they protected the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] "forever" from a European-[[North America|American|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] settlement.

Both the [[Sioux|Sioux|alias_match_match_candidate]] and [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne|alias_match_match_candidate]] also claimed rights to [[Black Hills|the land|non_person_coref]], saying that in their cultures, it was considered the "axis mundi", or sacred center of the world.

Although rumors of gold in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] had circulated for [[decades|DURATION]] (see [[Thoen Stone|Thoen Stone|annotation]] and [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|Pierre-Jean De Smet|annotation]]), it was not until [[1874|DATE]] that Brevet Major General [[George Armstrong Custer|George Armstrong Custer|annotation]] of the 7th [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]] Cavalry led an expedition there and discovered gold in French Creek.

[[The following year|DATE]], the [[Newton-Jenney Party|ORGANIZATION]] conducted the [[first|ORDINAL]] detailed survey of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

This highest point in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[7,242|NUMBER]] feet above sea level.

During the [[1875|DATE]]–[[1878|DATE]] gold rush, thousands of miners went to the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]]; in [[1880|DATE]], [[Mount Rushmore|the area|non_person_coref]] was the most densely populated part of the [[Dakota Territory|Dakota Territory|annotation]].

Lakota language###Lakota people###Sioux|Lakota|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] and their [[Cheyenne|Cheyenne|annotation]] and [[Arapaho|Arapaho|annotation]] allies in [[1876|DATE]], the [[United States|United States|alias_match_popular_entity]] took control of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]]

On [[July 23, 1980|DATE]], in "[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians|United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians|annotation]]", the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court of the United States|annotation]] ruled that the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] were illegally taken by the federal government and ordered remuneration of the initial offering price plus interest, nearly [[$106 million|MONEY]].

The [[Lakota people|Lakota|alias_match_multiple_candidates]] refused the settlement, as they wanted the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] returned to them.

They believe that accepting the settlement would allow the [[United States|US|alias_match_popular_redirect]] government to justify taking ownership of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

In an appeal issued [[August 21, 2012|DATE]], [[James Anaya|Anaya|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]] brought a sale of over [[1,900|NUMBER]] acres of land in [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] by the [[Reynolds|PERSON]] family to the attention of the [[United States|U.S.|LOCATION_popular_redirect]] government and asked that it disclose measures taken by federal or state governments to address [[Sioux|Sioux|alias_match_match_candidate]] concerns over the sale of [[Black Hills|the land|non_person_coref]] within [[Reynolds Prairie|ORGANIZATION]].

These acres consist of [[five|NUMBER]] land tracts, including the sacred Pe' Sla site for [[Sioux|Dakota|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], [[Lakota people|Lakota|alias_match_multiple_candidates]], and [[Nakota|ORGANIZATION]] peoples; natives to the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] fundraised to buy [[Black Hills|the land|non_person_coref]] during the [[Reynolds|PERSON]]' sale.

The geology of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] is complex.

A [[Tertiary|Tertiary|annotation]] mountain-building episode is responsible for the uplift and [[current|DATE]] topography of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] region.

This uplift was marked by volcanic activity in the northern [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

The southern [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] are characterized by [[Precambrian|Precambrian|annotation]] granite, pegmatite, and metamorphic rocks that comprise the core of the entire [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] uplift.

The stratigraphy of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] is laid out like a target, as it is an oval dome, with rings of different rock types dipping away from the center.

The granite of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] was emplaced by magma generated during the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny|Trans-Hudson orogeny|annotation]] and contains abundant pegmatite.

The core of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] has been dated to [[1.8 billion years|DURATION]].

[[Today|DATE]] we see the evidence of this erosion in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]], where the metamorphic rocks end in an angular unconformity below the younger sedimentary layers.

The final layers of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] consist of sedimentary rocks.

Above the [[Deadwood Formation|Deadwood Formation|alias_match_match_candidate]] lies the [[Englewood Formation|ORGANIZATION]] and Pahasapa limestone, which is the source of the more than [[200|NUMBER]] caves found in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]], including [[Jewel Cave National Monument|Jewel Cave|annotation]] and [[Wind Cave National Park|Wind Cave|annotation]].

It is mostly red shale with beds of gypsum, and circles much of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

It took a period of uplift to bring them to their [[present|DATE]] topographical levels in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

[[Black Hills|The Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] also has a 'skirt' of gravel covering them in areas, which are called pediments.

As with the geology, the biology of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] is complex.

Most of the Hills are a fire-climax ponderosa pine forest, with [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] spruce ("Picea glauca" var.

Oddly, this endemic variety of spruce does not occur in the moist [[Bear Lodge Mountains|Bear Lodge Mountains|annotation]], which make up most of the [[Wyoming|Wyoming|alias_match_match_candidate]] portion of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]].

Large open parks (mountain meadows) with lush grassland rather than forest are scattered through the Hills (especially the western portion), and the southern edge of the [[Black Hills|Hills|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], due to the rainshadow of the higher elevations, are covered by a dry pine savannah, with stands of mountain mahogany and [[Juniperus scopulorum|Rocky Mountain juniper|annotation]].

[[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] creeks are known for their trout, while the forests and grasslands offer good habitat for [[American bison|American bison|annotation]], white-tailed and mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, and a variety of smaller animals, like prairie dogs, [[American marten|American marten|annotation]]s, [[American red squirrel|American red squirrel|annotation]]s, [[Northern flying squirrel|Northern flying squirrel|annotation]]s, yellow-bellied marmots, and fox squirrels.

Biologically, the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] is a meeting and mixing place, with species common to regions to the east, west, north, and south.

Some other endemics are [[Cooper|ORGANIZATION]]'s Rocky Mountain snail, [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] subspecies of red-bellied snake, and a [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] subspecies of southern red-backed vole.

Some birds that are only in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] and not the rest of [[South Dakota|South Dakota|annotation]] are pinyon jay, [[Canada jay|Canada jay|annotation]], three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, [[American dipper|American dipper|annotation]], ruffed grouse, and others.

The northern [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] approximate [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence|annotation]] and [[Meade County, South Dakota|Meade|annotation]] Counties and are roughly equivalent to the [[North America|Northern|alias_match_single_candidate]] Hills District of the [[Black Hills National Forest|Black Hills National Forest|annotation]].

The central [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] (the [[Mystic District|LOCATION]] of the [[Black Hills National Forest|Black Hills National Forest|alias_match_match_candidate]]) are located in [[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County|annotation]] west of [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City|alias_match_redirect_candidate]].

The southern [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] are in [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County|annotation]] and are administered in the national forest's [[Hell Canyon District|ORGANIZATION]].

Finally, [[Wyoming|Wyoming|alias_match_match_candidate]]'s [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] follow the [[Bearlodge District|LOCATION]], approximately [[Weston County, Wyoming|Weston|annotation]] and [[Crook County, Wyoming|Crook|annotation]] Counties.

Geologically separate from the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] are the [[Elk Mountains (South Dakota)|Elk Mountains|annotation]], a small range forming the southwest portion of [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]].

. [[Black Hills|The Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] also hosts the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally|Sturgis Motorcycle Rally|annotation]] [[each|SET]] [[August|DATE]]

. [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally|the rally|non_person_coref]] was started in [[1940|DATE]] and the [[65th Rally|ORGANIZATION]] in [[2005|DATE]] saw more than [[550,000|NUMBER]] bikers visit the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]]. It is a key part of [[Wyoming|the region|non_person_coref]]al economy.

The [[George S. Mickelson|PERSON]] Trail is a [[recently|DATE]] opened multi-use path through the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] that follows the abandoned track of the historic railroad route from [[Edgemont, South Dakota|Edgemont|annotation]] to [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood|annotation]].

The train used to be the only way to bring supplies to the miners in the [[Black Hills|Hills|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]].

[[Today|DATE]], the major city in the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City|annotation]], with an incorporated population of almost [[70,000|NUMBER]] and a metropolitan population of [[125,000|NUMBER]].

In addition to tourism and mining (including coal, specialty minerals, and the [[now|DATE]] declining gold mining), the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] economy includes ranching (sheep and cattle, primarily, with bison and ratites becoming more common), timber (lumber), [[Ellsworth Air Force Base|Ellsworth Air Force Base|annotation]], and some manufacturing, including [[Black Hills gold jewelry|Black Hills gold jewelry|annotation]], cement, electronics, cabinetry, guns and ammunition.

In many ways, the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] functions as a very spread-out urban area with a population (not counting tourists) of [[250,000|NUMBER]].

Other important [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] cities and towns include:

*[[Hill City, South Dakota|Hill City|annotation]], a timber and tourism town in the center of the [[Black Hills|Hills|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]], where the [[Black Hills Central Railroad|Black Hills Central Railroad|annotation]] operates historic steam trains over the former CB&Q line to [[Keystone|ORGANIZATION]]

*[[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs|annotation]], an old resort town in the southern [[Black Hills|Hills|LOCATION_part_of_seen_entity]]

*[[Newcastle, Wyoming|Newcastle|annotation]], center of the [[Black Hills|Black Hills|alias_match_article_entity]] petroleum production and refining

Parc Montsouris

[[Parc Montsouris|Parc Montsouris|annotation]] is a public park situated in southern [[Paris|Paris|annotation]], [[France|France|annotation]].

[[Parc Montsouris|Parc Montsouris|alias_match_article_entity]] is [[one|NUMBER]] of the [[four|NUMBER]] large urban public parks, along with the [[Bois de Boulogne|Bois de Boulogne|annotation]], the [[Bois de Vincennes|Bois de Vincennes|annotation]] and the [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont|Parc des Buttes Chaumont|annotation]], created by Emperor [[Napoleon III|Napoleon III|annotation]] and [[Napoleon III|his|PERSON_coref]] Prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Georges-Eugène Haussmann|annotation]], at each of the cardinal points of the compass around [[Paris|the city|non_person_coref]], in order to provide green space and recreation for the rapidly growing population of [[Paris|Paris|alias_match_match_candidate]].

[[Parc Montsouris|Parc Montsouris|alias_match_article_entity]] is bounded to the south by [[Boulevards of the Marshals|Boulevard Jourdan|annotation]] and the [[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris|Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris|annotation]] ([[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris|CIUP|alias_match_redirect_candidate]]), to the north by [[Avenue Reille|PERSON]], to the east by [[Rue Gazan|ORGANIZATION]] and the Rue de la [[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris|Cité Universitaire|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] and to the west by [[Rue Nansouty|ORGANIZATION]] and [[Rue Émile Deutsch-de-la-Meurthe|ORGANIZATION]].

[[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris|Cité Universitaire|alias_match_redirect_candidate]] station on [[RER B|RER B|annotation]] is located in the southern part of [[Parc Montsouris|Parc Montsouris|alias_match_article_entity]], where it connects to [[Île-de-France tramway Lines 3a and 3b|Île-de-France tramway Line 3a|annotation]].

According to the official website of [[Parc Montsouris|the park|non_person_coref]] and other sources, the name of [[Parc Montsouris|the park|non_person_coref]] came from an old windmill, called the [[Moulin de Moque-Souris|ORGANIZATION]], which in [[the 18th century|DATE]] stood not far from [[Parc Montsouris|the park|non_person_coref]] site at the crossroads of rue d'Alesia and rue de la Tomb-Issoire.

The name over time changed from moque-souris to [[Parc Montsouris|Montsouris|alias_match_article_entity]].

Another possible origin of '[[Parc Montsouris|Montsouris|alias_match_article_entity]]' is common with the name of a former principal roadway, [[today|DATE]]'s rue de la Tombe Issoire: after leaving [[Paris|the city|non_person_coref]] to the south, it passed through a Roman-era cemetery that had fallen into disuse from [[the 4th century|DATE]], and it may have been [[one|NUMBER]] these abandoned tombs that an influential 13th-century writer declared to be the burial place of "Ysoré", a defeated giant of popular legend.

No matter the veracity of the story, many of the area's landmarks had taken the 'tombe Issoire' name by [[the 18th century|DATE]], and if 'Issoire' emerged from 'Ysoré', '[[Parc Montsouris|Montsouris|alias_match_article_entity]]' could be a 'mont [[Ysoré|PERSON]]' that evolved over time.

[[Parc Montsouris|the park|non_person_coref]] was built by [[Adolphe Alphand|Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand|annotation]], the engineer who headed the service of promenades and plantations created by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Georges-Eugène Haussmann|annotation]], with the assistance of city architect [[Gabriel Davioud|Gabriel Davioud|annotation]] and horticulturist [[Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps|Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps|annotation]].

Axeman of New Orleans

The [[Axeman of New Orleans|Axeman of New Orleans|annotation]] was an [[Americans|American|annotation]] serial killer active in [[New Orleans|New Orleans|annotation]], [[Louisiana|Louisiana|annotation]], and surrounding communities, including [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna|annotation]], from [[May 1918|DATE]] to [[October 1919|DATE]].

[[Axeman of New Orleans|The Axeman|alias_match_article_entity]] was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved.

[[Axeman of New Orleans|He|PERSON_coref]] mainly targeted [[Italians|Italian|annotation]] immigrants and [[Italian Americans|Italian-American|annotation]]s.

As [[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]]'s epithet implies, the victims usually were attacked with an axe, which often belonged to the victims themselves.

The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from [[Axeman of New Orleans|his|PERSON_coref]] victims' homes.

A less plausible theory is that [[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]] committed the murders in an attempt to promote jazz music, suggested by a letter attributed to [[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]] in which [[Damon Wilson|he|PERSON_coref]] stated that [[Damon Wilson|he|PERSON_coref]] would spare the lives of those who played jazz in their homes.

[[Axeman of New Orleans|The Axeman|alias_match_article_entity]] was not caught or identified, and [[Axeman of New Orleans|his|PERSON_coref]] crime spree stopped as mysteriously as it had started.

On [[March 13, 1919|DATE]], a letter purporting to be from the Axeman was published in newspapers, saying that [[Axeman of New Orleans|he|PERSON_coref]] would kill again at [[15 minutes past midnight|TIME]] on [[the night of|TIME]] [[March 19|DATE]] but would spare the occupants of any place where a jazz band was playing.

Esteemed Mortal of [[New Orleans|New Orleans|alias_match_match_candidate]]: [[Axeman of New Orleans|The Axeman|alias_match_article_entity]]

I shall leave no clue except my bloody axe, besmeared with blood and brains of [[Axeman of New Orleans|he|PERSON_coref]] whom I have sent below to keep me company.

[[Colin Wilson|Wilson|PERSON_part_of_seen_entity]]'s explanation is an urban legend, and there is no more evidence [[now|DATE]] on the identity of [[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]] than there was at the [[time|DATE]] of the crimes.

While radically different than the [[Axeman of New Orleans|Axeman|ORGANIZATION_part_of_seen_entity]]'s usual modus operandi, if [[Joseph Momfre|PERSON]] was indeed the Axeman, the Schiambras may well have been early victims of [[the future|DATE]] serial killer.

[[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]] broke into the home, and then proceeded to cut the couple's throats with a straight razor.

[[John Dantonio|He|PERSON_coref]] later went on to describe [[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]] as a real-life "Dr. [[Jekyl|PERSON]] and Mr. [[Hyde|PERSON]]".

Mrs. [[Pepitone|PERSON]], the mother of [[six|NUMBER]] children, was unable to describe any characteristics of [[Axeman of New Orleans|the killer|non_person_coref]].
