Common vampire bat

The common vampire bat ("[[Common vampire bat|Desmodus rotundus|alias_match_article_entity]]") is a small, leaf-nosed bat native to [[Latin America|Latin America|annotation]].

[[Common vampire bat|the bat|non_person_coref]] usually approaches its prey at [[night|TIME]] while they are sleeping. It then uses its razor-sharp teeth to cut open the skin of its hosts and lap up their blood with its long tongue.

Another description was published in [[1826|DATE]] as a new species "Desmodus rufus" by [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied|Maximilian Wied|annotation]], in the [[second|ORDINAL]] volume of [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied|his|PERSON_coref]] work detailing [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied|his|PERSON_coref]] explorations in [[Brazil|Brazil|LOCATION_popular_entity]], erecting a new genus "Desmodus".

The species received several scientific names before being given its [[current|DATE]] [[one|NUMBER]]—"[[Common vampire bat|Desmodus rotundus|alias_match_article_entity]]"—by [[Oldfield Thomas|Oldfield Thomas|annotation]] in [[1901|DATE]].

A description published under the name "Desmodus puntajudensi" ([[Common vampire bat|Cuban vampire bat|alias_match_article_entity]]) by [[Woloszyn|PERSON]] and [[Mayo|ORGANIZATION]] in [[1974|DATE]] was later recognized as synonymous with this species.

[[Common vampire bat|the bat|non_person_coref]] averages about [[9|NUMBER]] cm ([[3.5|NUMBER]] in) long with a wingspan of [[18|NUMBER]] cm ([[7|NUMBER]] in).

This ability likely evolved independently within [[Common vampire bat|the bat|non_person_coref]] lineage.

The common vampire bat is found in parts of [[Mexico|Mexico|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Central America|Central America|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and [[South America|South America|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

Fossils of this species have been found in [[Florida|Florida|LOCATION_popular_entity]] and states bordering [[Mexico|Mexico|LOCATION_popular_entity]].

The southern extent of its range is [[Uruguay|Uruguay|LOCATION_popular_entity]], northern [[Argentina|Argentina|LOCATION_popular_entity]], and central

[[Chile|Chile|LOCATION_popular_entity]]

. In the [[West Indies|West Indies|LOCATION_popular_entity]], [[Common vampire bat|the bat|non_person_coref]] is only found on [[Trinidad|Trinidad|LOCATION_popular_entity]]

Mating usually lasts [[three to four minutes|DURATION]]; the male bat mounts the female from the posterior end, grasps [[her|PERSON]] back with [[Oldfield Thomas|his|PERSON_coref]] teeth, holds down [[her|PERSON]] folded wings, and inseminates [[her|PERSON]].

Regurgitated food sharing in common vampire bats has been studied in both the lab and field, and is predicted by kinship, association, and reciprocal help In a field study conducted in [[Costa Rica|Costa Rica|LOCATION_popular_entity]] from [[1978|DATE]] [[to|DATE]] [[1983|DATE]], vampire bats frequently switched between several roost trees and co-roosted with kin and non-kin.

[[Joseph Lennox Pawan|He|PERSON_coref]] soon proved various species of bat, including the common vampire bat, are capable of transmitting rabies for an extended period of time without artificial infection or external symptoms.

During this asymptomatic stage, [[Common vampire bat|the bat|non_person_coref]]s continue to behave normally and breed.

There is evidence that it is possible for the rabies virus to infect a host purely through airborne transmission, without direct physical contact of the victim with [[Common vampire bat|the bat|non_person_coref]].

A genetically engineered drug called desmoteplase, which uses the anticoagulant properties of the saliva of "[[Common vampire bat|Desmodus rotundus|alias_match_article_entity]]", has been shown to increase blood flow in stroke patients.
